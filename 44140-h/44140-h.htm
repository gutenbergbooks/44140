<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The excellent Matthew Henry has very truly said,
"There are remains of great and good men, which,
like Elijah's mantle, ought to be gathered up and preserved
by the survivors&mdash;their sayings, their writings,
their examples; that as their works follow them in
the reward of them, they may stay behind in the benefit
of them."</p>

<p>Influenced by this and kindred sentiments, the
compiler of this volume has devoted no small labor
to gather from every source to which he could gain
access, whatever appeared to him important to be
known respecting the most distinguished uninspired
preacher perhaps of any age or country. Whatever
may be the faults of the work, to use the language of
the Rev. Dr. Campbell, one of the present pastors of
Whitefield's churches in London, in reference to a
short sketch he had himself prepared of our great
evangelist, "It will serve to bring him and his apostolic
labors before the minds of vast multitudes of
the rising generation, to whom both are all but unknown;
and this is far from unimportant. Whatever
tends to fix the minds of men afresh upon the
character of <span class="smcap">Whitefield</span> is, and it always will be,
something gained to the cause of true religion. The
contemplation of that character is one of the most
healthful exercises that can occupy a Christian heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
or a Christian understanding. It is an admirable
theme for ministerial meditation. It tends equally to
humble, to instruct, and to encourage; to excite love
to Christ, zeal for his glory, and compassion for the
souls of men. What Alexander and C&#230;sar, Charles
XII. of Sweden and Napoleon the first, are to those
of the sons of men who have not yet ceased to 'learn
war,' that Whitefield and Wesley are to those who
aspire to eminent usefulness as ministers and missionaries
of the cross."</p>

<p>In the preparation of this memoir, the compiler
has sought to collect together incidents which might
interest and instruct, especially in connection with
Whitefield's labors in America; to present him as
much as possible in his own dress; and to use the
facts of his life to excite and cherish his own spirit,
so far as he had the spirit of Christ. Facts reflecting
on the reputation and feelings of others have
been used only as the interests of truth seemed to
demand.</p>

<p>It would have been easy to place on almost every
page an array of authorities, and to give here a long
list of friends to whom the writer has been indebted
for aid; but the sole object of the volume is the honor
of Christ in the salvation of men, and that this may
be accomplished, we pray that the blessing of Heaven
may rest upon it.</p>

<h2>GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>MORAL STATE OF GREAT BRITAIN IN THE EARLY
PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY&mdash;WHITEFIELD
FROM HIS BIRTH TO HIS FIRST SERMON.</h3></blockquote>


<p>That we may have a clear and comprehensive view
of the labors and success of George Whitefield, it is
important that we consider the moral condition of
Great Britain and its dependencies when the Head of
the church brought him on the field of action. The
latter part of the seventeenth and the beginning of the
eighteenth centuries presented in that country a scene
of moral darkness, the more remarkable as it so soon
succeeded the triumph of evangelical truth which distinguished
the seventeenth century, and which is perpetuated
in a religious literature that will bless the
world. Causes had long been at work which produced
such insensibility and decline as to all that is
good, and such a bold and open activity in evil, as it
is hoped the grace of God may avert from his churches
in all future time. The doctrine of the divine right
of kings to implicit obedience on the part of their subjects;
the principle of priestly control of the minds of
men in religious matters; and clerical influence, sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
by kingly authority, in favor of sports on the
Lord's day, together with the evil examples of men high
in rank and power, had produced their natural results
on the masses of the people, and make it painful, even
at this distant period, to survey the scene.</p>

<p>Nor were these all the evils of that day. The expulsion
from their pulpits, by the "Act of Uniformity,"
of two thousand of the most able and useful of
the clergy in England, had led to great ignorance
and neglect of religion; and though men like Leighton
and Owen, Flavel and Baxter, with Bunyan and
a host of others, had continued, in spite of opposing
laws, to preach when they were not shut up in prison,
and to write their immortal practical works, by the
time of which we are speaking they had been called
to their eternal reward, leaving very few men of like
spirit behind them. Thus infidelity, profligacy, and
formalism almost universally prevailed.</p>

<p>The low state of religion in the established church
at that time may be learned from the Rev. Augustus
M. Toplady, himself one of its ministers, who died in
1778. In a sermon yet extant he says, "I believe no
denomination of professing Christians, the church of
Rome excepted, were so generally void of the light
and life of godliness, so generally destitute of the doctrine
and of the grace of the gospel, as was the church
of England, considered as a body, about fifty years
ago. At that period a <em>converted</em> minister in the establishment
was as great a wonder as a comet; but now,
blessed be God, since that precious, that great apostle
of the English empire, the late dear Mr. Whitefield,
was raised up in the spirit and power of Elias, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
word of God has run and been glorified; many have
believed and been added to the Lord all over the
three kingdoms; and blessed be his name, the great
Shepherd and Bishop of souls continues still to issue
his word, and great is the company of preachers,
greater and greater every year."</p>

<p>If it be said that Toplady, as he belonged to a
different school of theology from that which then generally
prevailed, could scarcely be expected to be
impartial, we ask leave to transcribe a few lines from
Bishop Butler, who within six months of Whitefield's
ordination wrote thus: "It is come, I know not how,
to be taken for granted by many persons, that Christianity
is not so much as a subject of inquiry; but
that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious.
And accordingly they treat it as if in the present age
this were an agreed point among all people of discernment;
and nothing remained but to set it up as a
principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were by
way of reprisals for its having so long interrupted the
pleasures of the world." Bishop Warburton, who
commenced his ministry a few years before Whitefield,
and who cannot be charged with enthusiasm,
says, "I have lived to see that fatal crisis, when religion
hath lost its hold on the minds of the people."</p>

<p>Many other witnesses might be brought to testify
that error and worldly mindedness had made mournful
havoc among the clergy, and that spiritual religion
had been almost buried in forms and ceremonies.
A recent writer has well described the state of religion
in the established church at that time, as only to
be compared to a frozen or palsied carcass. "There,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
says this Episcopal clergyman, "were the time-honored
formularies which the wisdom of the reformers had
provided. There were the services and lessons from
Scripture, just in the same order as we have them now.
But as to preaching the gospel, in the established
church there was almost none. The distinguishing
doctrines of Christianity&mdash;the atonement, the work
and office of Christ and the Spirit&mdash;were comparatively
lost sight of. The vast majority of sermons
were miserable moral essays, utterly devoid of any
thing calculated to awaken, convert, save, or sanctify
souls." Southey, a biographer of Wesley, who assuredly
will not be accused of too strong a tendency to
evangelical truth, is compelled to say, "A laxity of
opinions as well as morals obtained, and infidelity, a
plague which had lately found its way into the country,
was becoming so prevalent, that the vice-chancellor
of the university at Oxford, in a <em>programma</em>, exhorted
the tutors to discharge their duties by double diligence,
and had forbidden the under-graduates to read
such books as might tend to the weakening of their
faith."</p>

<p>There were undoubtedly some learned and conscientious
bishops at this era. Such men were Secker
and Gibson, Lowth and Horne, Butler, and others.
But even the best of them seem sadly to have misunderstood
the requirements of the day they lived in.
They spent their strength in writing apologies for
Christianity, and contending against infidels. They
could not see that without the direct preaching of the
essential doctrines of the gospel, their labors must be
sadly defective. The man who dared to preach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
doctrines of the Bible, and in harmony with the Articles
and Homilies of his church, was set down as an
enthusiast or fanatic.</p>

<p>Among those who had dissented from the established
hierarchy, and who were untrammelled by the
impositions of secular authority, the state of vital godliness
was also unhappily very low. The noble spirits
of early non-conformity had passed from earth, or
crossed the Atlantic to the frozen shores of New England,
and a race of men had sprung up, some of whom
retained the tenets of orthodoxy, but had lost its
power; while others reposed on comfortable endowments,
and lulled themselves, or were drawn by favorable
breezes, into the cold elements of Arianism and
Socinianism. As persons in the frozen regions are
said to sleep longer and more soundly than others, so
did they; and a more terrific blast of the trumpet of
the gospel was required to rouse and awake them
from their spiritual slumbers. Happily indeed for the
world, and for the church in it, there were some exceptions.
Watts and Guyse and Doddridge, and their
pious associates in different parts of the land, were
laborers together in "God's husbandry," and ceased
not to cultivate it with affectionate faithfulness and
care; and wherever their labors extended, the plants
of grace grew and flourished. Darracott, "the star of
the west," threw his mild rays over the vales of Somerset;
and in the north also a few faithful men were
found.</p>

<p>Nor have we even now said all that should be
written as to the character of those times. The highest
personages in the land then openly lived in ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
contrary to the law of God, and no man rebuked
them. Profligacy and irreligion were reputable and
respectable. Judging from the description we have
of men and manners in those days, a gentleman might
have been defined as a creature who got drunk, gambled,
swore, fought duels, and violated the seventh
commandment, and for all this very few thought the
worse of him.</p>

<p>Those too were the days when the men whom even
kings delighted to honor were such as Bolingbroke,
Chesterfield, Walpole, and Newcastle. To be an infidel,
to obtain power by intrigue, and to retain it by
the grossest and most notorious bribery, were considered
no disqualifications even for the highest offices.
Such men indeed were not only tolerated, but praised.
In those days too, Hume, an avowed infidel, put forth
his History, and obtained a pension. Sterne and
Swift then wrote their talented, but obscene books;
both of them were clergymen, but the public saw little
inconsistency in their conduct. Fielding and Smollett
were the popular authors, and the literary taste
of high and low was suited by Roderick Random,
Peregrine Pickle, Joseph Andrews, and Tom Jones.
These authors were ingenious heathen philosophers,
assuming the name of Christians, and forcibly paganizing
Christianity for the sake of pleasing the world.</p>

<p>Turning to <em>Scotland</em>, we find that the bold proclamation
of the discriminating truths of the gospel
which characterize the preaching of Knox, Welsh,
and others, was being rapidly laid aside, and cold
formal addresses, verging towards a kind of Socinianism
were becoming fashionable. Old Mr. Hutchinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
minister of Kilellan, in Renfrewshire, who saw
but the beginning of this sad change, used to say to
Wodrow the historian, "When I compare the times
before the restoration with those since the revolution,
I must own that the young ministers preach accurately,
and methodically; but there was far more of the
power and efficacy of the Spirit and of the grace of
God went along with sermons in those days than now.
For my own part&mdash;all the glory be to God&mdash;I seldom
set my foot in a pulpit in those days, but I had notice
of the blessed effects of the word." It is true, that
even then there were a few faithful witnesses for God
in Scotland, such as the brothers Erskine, in the Secession
church; but for the most part, coldness, barrenness,
and death prevailed. The people knew not
God, and were strangers to the life-giving influence
and power of the gospel.</p>

<p>The Arianism of England had been carried to the
north of <em>Ireland</em>, and finding a state of feeling suitable
to its reception, it took root and grew up, so
as to characterize a distinct section of the Presbyterian
church, then and still distinguished by the
name of the Remonstrant Synod. The south and
west of Ireland were subjected to a blight not less
withering, though of a different kind, and which continued
much longer&mdash;continued, to a great extent,
throughout the whole of the last century. The clergy
were usually sons of the gentry, and accustomed to
their sporting, drinking, and riotous habits. They
had no preparation for ministerial duties but a college
degree; and no education, either literary or
moral, which had not been obtained among wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
young men at the university. According to the interest
which they happened to have, they passed at
once from college to ministerial charges, and again
mixed in all the dissipations of the districts where
these lay. Ignorant of the truth, they and their congregations
were satisfied with some short moral discourse.
Many of the people were almost as ignorant
of the Scriptures and scripture truth as the inhabitants
of Hindostan. The Catholic priests meanwhile
were at work among the people, and they had many
to help them. The sick and the dying were watched;
their fears were wrought upon; they were told of
the power which the priests had, of the influence possessed
by the Virgin, and much about the <em>old church</em>;
and as soon as any seemed to give way, on whatever
point, the priest was sent for, who plied them anew,
and seldom failed in succeeding with the poor ignorant
people. They were now ready to receive absolution;
but he had farther conditions to propose.
The whole family must submit to be rebaptized, or at
least promise to attend mass&mdash;and this also was not
unfrequently gained; the Protestant clergyman being
all the while at a distance, neither knowing nor much
caring what was going on. In this way great numbers
of the lower and middle classes of the Protestants
went over to the church of Rome. Throughout
whole districts the Protestant churches were almost
emptied, and many of those in rural districts were
allowed to fall into ruins.</p>

<p>Of <em>Wales</em> it is not important at present to say
much. From the middle ages downwards, great darkness
and superstition had prevailed among its mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
It is true that in the days of James I., a clergyman
named Wroth, whose conversion to the truth
had been remarkable, had labored with eminent zeal
and success, but at the period of which we are now
writing declension had succeeded. Within the establishment
all was cold and dead; nearly every minister
was ignorant of the Welsh language, a fact which
also applied to several successive bishops, while the
state of morals, among even the leaders of the hierarchy,
was truly deplorable. An old Methodist simply
but truly described the country at this period, and of
his correct narrative we will here give a free translation.</p>

<p>The land, he tells us, was dark indeed. Scarcely
any of the lower ranks could read at all. The morals
of the country were very corrupt; and in this
respect there was no difference between high and low,
layman and clergyman. Gluttony, drunkenness, and
licentiousness prevailed through the whole country.
Nor were the operations of the church at all adapted
to repress these evils. From the pulpit the name of
the Redeemer was scarcely heard; nor was much mention
made of the natural sinfulness of man, or of the
influence of the Holy Spirit. On Sunday mornings,
the poor were more constant in their attendance at
church than the gentry; but the Sunday evenings
were spent by all in idle amusements. Every Sabbath
there was practised a kind of sport, called in Welsh
<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Achwaren-gamp</i>, in which all the young men of the
neighborhood had a trial of strength, and the people
assembled from the surrounding country to witness
their feats. On a Saturday night, particularly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
summer, the young men and women held what they
called <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Nosweithian cann</i>, or singing eves; that is, they
met together and amused themselves by singing in
turns to the harp, till the dawn of the Sabbath.
These things, with the performance of rustic dramas,
would occupy sometimes the whole of the sacred day
itself; while a set of vagabonds, called the <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Bobl
gerdded</i>, or walking people, used to traverse the villages,
begging with impunity, to the disgrace alike of
the law and the country. With all this social sprightliness,
the Welsh were then a superstitious, and even
a gloomy people. They still retained many habits
apparently derived from paganism, and not a few of
the practices of popery. Their funerals, like those of
the Irish, were scenes of riot and drunkenness, followed
by prayers for the release of the deceased from
the pains of purgatory. Such was the superstition of
the people, that when Methodism was first introduced
among them, many of the peasantry expressed their
horror of the new opinions by the truly Popish gesture
of crossing the forehead; and when Wesley first
visited them, he pronounced them "as little versed in
the principles of Christianity as a Creek or Cherokee
Indian." To this declaration he added the striking
remark, that, "notwithstanding their superstition and
ignorance, the people 'were ripe for the gospel,' and
most enthusiastically anxious to avail themselves of
every opportunity of instruction."</p>

<p>As an illustration of the truth of the remark we
have just introduced from the discerning Wesley, we
may mention an incident which occurred in 1736. At
this period dissent itself was reduced so low in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
country, that there were only six dissenting houses of
worship in all North Wales. One Sunday, Mr. Lewis
Rees, a dissenting minister from South Wales, and the
father of Dr. Rees, the author of the celebrated Cyclopedia
which bears his name, visited Pwllheli, a town
on the promontory of Sl&#235;yn, in Caernarvonshire, and
one of the few places in which the Independents still
had a chapel. After the service, the congregation,
collecting around him, complained very sorely that
their numbers were rapidly diminishing, that the few
who yet remained were for the most part poor, and
that every thing connected with their cause looked
gloomy. To which the minister replied, "The dawn
of religion is again breaking out in South Wales,"
referring them to the fact, that already a distinguished
man&mdash;Howel Harris&mdash;had risen up, going
about instructing the people in the truths of the
gospel. Such was the character of the times when
God was raising up agents to revive and extend his
cause. We shall before long return to Wales with
lively interest.</p>

<p>"Such," says the eloquent Robert Hall, "was the
situation of things when Whitefield and Wesley made
their appearance, who, whatever failings the severest
criticism can discover in their character, will be hailed
by posterity as the second reformers of England.
Nothing was farther from the views of these excellent
men than to innovate on the established religion of
their country; their sole aim was to recall the people
to the good old way, and to imprint the doctrines of
the Articles and Homilies on the spirits of men. But
this doctrine had been so long a dead letter, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
completely obliterated from the mind by contrary
instructions, that the attempt to revive it met with
all the opposition that innovation is sure to encounter,
in addition to what naturally results from the
nature of the doctrine itself, which has to contend
with the whole force of human corruption. The revival
of the <em>old</em>, appeared like the introduction of a
<em>new</em> religion; and the hostility it excited was less
sanguinary, but scarcely less virulent, than that which
signalized the first publication of Christianity. The
gospel of Christ, or that system of truth which was
laid at the foundation of the Reformation, has since
made rapid advances, and in every step of its progress
has sustained the most furious assaults."</p>

<p>It ought here to be stated, as illustrating the providence
of God in preparing the British empire for the
reception of the gospel, that the revolution of 1688
introduced the spirit of toleration, and in 1714, the
very year of Whitefield's birth, Anne, the last English
sovereign of a persecuting spirit, died, and the throne
was assumed by George I., the first prince of the
house of Hanover. The way of the Lord was thus
prepared for bright illustrations of his mercy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rising from the beautiful valley of the Severn, and
on the borders of that noble stream, reposes in antique
glory the affluent city of <span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, with its
regular streets, and its majestic cathedral and other
relics of bygone days. In that city the traveller
may examine three spots which will long be interesting
to the student of ecclesiastical curiosities. The
first of these is the ancient church of Mary de Crypt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
where reposes the dust of Robert Raikes, the founder
of Sunday-schools; the second, is the little stone
which, in a pensive-looking inclosure, marks the site
on which the truly noble-minded and Protestant Bishop
Hooper was burnt, an early martyr of bloody Mary's
reign. There wicked men stood around to light up
the flames, and to mock his sorrows; but as we stand
and look, we exult in the subsequent triumphs of
truth.</p>

<p>The third spot, and the one to us at the present
moment the most interesting, is the Bell inn or hotel,
yet standing, though enlarged and beautified since
the period of which we write. There <span class="smcap">Whitefield</span>&mdash;the
saint, the seraph, the "angel flying in the midst
of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to
them that dwell on the earth"&mdash;first breathed the
vital air. Venerable city, we will rejoice that though
within thy walls one glorious luminary of salvation
was extinguished, another "burning and shining light"
was raised up to diffuse joy and happiness over the
two most influential quarters of the globe, and a third
has since been given to suggest the simple plan by
which millions of the young have already acquired
the knowledge of salvation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>, the sixth son of Thomas and
Elizabeth Whitefield, was born December 16, 1714, old
style. Concerning his father and mother he writes,
"The former died when I was two years old; the
latter died in December, 1751, in the seventy-first
year of her age, and has often told me how she endured
fourteen weeks' sickness after she brought me
into the world; but was used to say, even when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was an infant, that she expected more comfort from
me than from any other of her children. This, with the
circumstance of my being born in an inn, has often
been of service to me, in exciting my endeavors to
make good my mother's expectations, and so follow
the example of my dear Saviour, who was laid in a
manger belonging to an inn."</p>

<p>In one of his journals, which he commenced at a
very early part of his ministry, Whitefield details with
great simplicity many incidents of his childhood and
youth; from which it appears, that though at times
he had many serious thoughts and impressions, the
general course of his life, till the age of sixteen, was
irreligious. He tells us that in early youth he was
"so brutish as to hate instruction, and used purposely
to shun all opportunities of receiving it," and that
he spent much money, improperly obtained from his
mother, in cards, plays, and romances, "which," says
he, "were my heart's delight. Often have I joined
with others in playing roguish tricks; but was generally,
if not always, happily detected: for this I have
often since, and do now bless and praise God." His
full confessions of this character are very affecting,
and should be a caution to young persons to repel all
such temptations.</p>

<p>When George was about ten years of age, his
mother married a second time, thus forming a connection
which led to much unhappiness. He was, however,
continued at school; and when twelve years old,
was transferred to the grammar-school of St. Mary de
Crypt, where he remained about three years. Having
a graceful elocution and a good memory, he gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
much credit for delivering speeches before the city
corporation at the annual visitation of the school, and
received pecuniary rewards for his performances on
those occasions. How deeply he afterwards deplored
these celebrations, especially the performance of plays
in connection with his school-fellows, may be learned
from his own words: "I cannot but observe here,
with much concern of mind, how this way of training
up youth has a natural tendency to debauch the mind,
to raise ill passions, and to stuff the memory with
things as contrary to the gospel of Christ, as darkness
to light, hell to heaven." This sad tendency was
but too clearly evinced in the case of Whitefield himself.
"I got acquainted," he says, "with such a set
of debauched, abandoned, atheistical youths, that if
God, by his free, unmerited, and special grace, had
not delivered me out of their hands, I should have sat
in the scorner's chair, and made a mock at sin. By
keeping company with them, my thoughts of religion
grew more and more like theirs. I went to public
service only to make sport, and walk about. I took
pleasure in their lewd conversation. I began to reason
as they did, and to ask why God had given me
passions, and not permitted me to gratify them. In
short, I soon made great proficiency in the school of
the devil. I affected to look rakish, and was in a
fair way of being as infamous as the worst of them."
These were the things, and not oratory, as has sometimes
been said, which Whitefield learned from plays
and acting.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, his conscience often made
him unhappy; and he wished, if possible, to combine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
religion with his pleasures. He purchased and carefully
read "Ken's Manual for Winchester Scholars,"
a book which commended itself as having comforted
his mother in her afflictions, and which he afterwards
considered to have been "of great benefit to his
soul."</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, he thought he had acquired
learning enough for any ordinary occupation in life,
and as his mother's business was declining, he persuaded
her to allow him to leave school and assist in
labor. "I began," says he, "to assist her occasionally
in the public-house, till at length I put on my blue
apron and my snuffers, washed mops, cleaned rooms,
and in one word, became professed and common <em>drawer</em>
for nearly a year and a half." In the midst of the
activity called for in such a situation, it pleased God
to renew his religious impressions, which induced him,
at least at intervals, to attend with much earnestness
to the concerns of his soul.</p>

<p>From his childhood, Whitefield tells us, he "was
always fond of being a clergyman, and used frequently
to imitate the ministers' reading prayers." Nor did
this tendency towards clerical engagements cease as
he became older. "Notwithstanding," he says, "I
was thus employed in a large inn, and had sometimes
the care of the whole house upon my hands, yet I composed
two or three sermons, and dedicated one of
them to my elder brother. One day, I remember, I
was very much pressed to self-examination, and found
myself very unwilling to look into my heart. Frequently
I read the Bible when sitting up at night.
And a dear youth, now with God, would often entreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
me, when serving at the bar, to go to Oxford. My
general answer was, 'I wish I could.'"</p>

<p>His mother's difficulties increasing, it became necessary
for her to leave the inn; in which she was succeeded
by one of her married sons, with whom George
for some time remained to continue his assistance in
the business. Some disagreement, however, arising
between them, he after a time took his departure from
the inn, and went to spend a month with his eldest
brother at Bristol. Returning from that city to Gloucester,
he resided for a short season with his mother.
While thus living unemployed, without any definite
object before him, and waiting the openings of providence,
his mother was visited by an Oxford student,
a servitor of Pembroke college in that university.
In the course of their conversation, he told her, that
after all his expenses at college for the quarter
were discharged, he had one penny remaining. She
immediately exclaimed, "This will do for my son!"
and turning to him, said, "Will you go to Oxford,
George?" He replied, "With all my heart." Application
was immediately made to several friends who
had influence at the college, and they pledged themselves
to serve her. In this confidence, her favorite
son returned to the grammar-school, where he not
only resumed his studies with greater diligence, but
endeavored, and not altogether in vain, to promote
religion and virtue among his associates.</p>

<p>Having fully secured his literary preparation for
the university, Whitefield removed to Oxford in his
eighteenth year, and was immediately admitted, as a
servitor, into Pembroke college. He soon found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the seat of learning was also a scene of danger. From
the period of 1662, when the two thousand Non-conformists
had been expelled from the church, the universities
had been sinking into a moral lethargy, preferring
uniformity to vital religion. Our young servitor
was shocked with the impiety of the students in
general, and dreading their influence on himself, he
as much as possible abstained from their society, and
shut himself up in his study.</p>

<p>Before he went to Oxford, Whitefield had heard
of a class of young men in the university who "lived
by rule and method," and were therefore called <em>Methodists</em>.
They were much talked of, and generally
despised. Of this party, John Wesley, a Fellow of
Lincoln college, and already in holy orders, was the
leader, his brother Charles being also as warmly attached
to it. They avowed that the great object of
their lives was to save their souls, and to live wholly
to the glory of God; and rarely have men subjected
themselves to greater self-denials and austerities.
Drawn towards them by kindred feelings, Whitefield
strenuously defended them whenever he heard them
reviled, and when he saw them going, through a crowd
manifesting their ridicule, every Sunday to receive the
sacrament at St. Mary's or Christ church, he was
strongly inclined to follow their example.</p>

<p>For more than a year he intensely desired to be
acquainted with them, but a sense of his pecuniary
inferiority to them prevented his advances. At length,
learning that a pauper had attempted suicide, Whitefield
sent a poor woman to inform Charles Wesley,
that so he might visit her, and administer religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
instruction. He charged the woman not to tell Mr.
Wesley who sent her, but, contrary to this injunction,
she told his name; and Charles Wesley, who had frequently
seen Whitefield walking by himself, on the
next morning invited him to breakfast. An introduction
to the little brotherhood soon followed, and he
also, like them, "began to live by rule, and pick up
the very fragments of his time, that not a moment
might be lost."</p>

<p>It is painful to read Whitefield's own account of the
mortifications of body to which he now submitted; and
we are not surprised that, as the result, his health
was so reduced as to place even his life in danger.
All this time he had no clear view of the way of salvation,
and was "seeking to work out a righteousness
of his own." In this state he lay on his bed, his
tongue parched with fever, and the words of the dying
Saviour, "I thirst," were impressed on his mind.
Remembering that this thirst occurred near the end
of the Saviour's sufferings, the thought arose in his
mind, "Why may it not be so with me? Why may
I not now receive deliverance and comfort? Why
may I not now dare to trust and rejoice in the pardoning
mercy of God?" There was, as Tracy has
said, no reason why he might not&mdash;why he ought not.
He saw nothing to forbid him. He prayed in hope,
borrowing language from the fact which suggested
the train of thought&mdash;"I thirst, I thirst for faith in
pardoning love. Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief." His prayer was heard. He dared to trust
in the mercy of God, as revealed in the death of Jesus
Christ for sinners. Conscience and his Bible bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
witness that he did right. The load that had so
heavily oppressed him, the load of guilt and terror
and anxiety, that weighed down his spirit while he
sinfully and ungratefully hesitated to trust in divine
mercy, was gone. He saw the trustworthiness of the
mercy of God in Christ, and his heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>"Though," as Tracy has well said, "the English
universities were established mainly for the purpose
of educating men for the ministry, Whitefield was not
likely to gain a good knowledge of theology there.
He took another, and a characteristic course. Some
time after his conversion, when he was at Gloucester,
he says, 'I began to read the holy Scriptures upon my
knees; laying aside all other books, and praying over,
if possible, every line and word. This proved meat
indeed and drink indeed to my soul. I daily received
fresh life, light, and power from above. I thus got
more true knowledge in reading the book of God in
one month, than I could ever have acquired from all
the writings of men.'"</p>

<p>Every hour of Whitefield's time, especially after
he had been "filled with peace and joy in believing,"
was sacredly devoted to preparation for the great
work to which he had now solemnly devoted himself.
He visited the prisoners in the jail, and the poor in
their cottages, and gave as much time as he could to
communion with God in his closet. His friends now
earnestly importuned him to apply for ordination;
but from this his deep sense of unworthiness made
him shrink. Besides, he intended to have a hundred
and fifty sermons carefully written before he began
to preach. He had as yet but one, and he lent that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a neighboring clergyman, to convince him that he was
not yet fit to be ordained. The clergyman kept it
for two weeks, divided it into two, preached it to his
own people, and then returned it to Whitefield, with
a guinea for the use of it.</p>

<p>Still, however, the work of preparation for the
ministry was rapidly going on. The state of his
health compelled him to retire for a season from Oxford,
and he returned home to increase the depth of
his piety, and to be led, little as he thought of it, at
once to the pulpit. He writes, "O what sweet communion
had I daily vouchsafed with God in prayer,
after my coming to Gloucester. How often have I
been carried out beyond myself, when meditating in
the fields. How assuredly I felt that Christ dwelt in
me, and I in him; and how daily did I walk in the
comforts of the Holy Ghost, and was edified and refreshed
in the multitude of peace. I always observed
that as my inward strength increased, so my outward
sphere of action increased proportionably."</p>

<p>Thus, happy in himself, and thankful to the gracious
God who made him so, the affectionate soul of
George Whitefield ardently desired that others might
participate in his sacred joys. In order to advance
this object, he mixed in the society of young people,
and endeavored to awaken them to a just sense of the
nature of true religion. Some were convinced of the
truth, and united with him in religious exercises; and
these were some of the first-fruits of his pious labors.
His discovery of the necessity of regeneration, like
Melancthon's great discovery of the truth, led him to
imagine that no one could resist the evidence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
convinced his own mind. He writes, "Upon this,
like the woman of Samaria, when Christ revealed
himself to her at the well, I had no rest in my soul
till I wrote letters to my relations, telling them
there was such a thing as the <em>new birth</em>. I imagined
they would have gladly received it; but, alas, my
words seemed to them as idle tales. They thought I
was going beside myself." He visited the jail every
day, and read and prayed with the prisoners; attended
public worship very frequently, and read twice
or three times a week to some poor people in the city.
In addition to all this, he tells us, "During my stay
here, God enabled me to give a public testimony of
my repentance as to seeing and acting plays; for
hearing the strollers had come to town, and knowing
what an egregious offender I had been, I was stirred
up to extract Mr. Law's excellent treatise, entitled,
"The absolute Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertainment."
The printer, at my request, put a little of it
in the newspaper for six weeks successively; and God
was pleased to give it his blessing."</p>

<p>In this manner Whitefield employed himself during
nine months; and one effect of so doing was, that
the partition wall of bigotry was soon broken down
in his heart. He says, "I loved all, of whatever denomination,
who loved the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity."
This statement in his diary is connected
with an account of the benefit he derived from studying
the works of the Non-conformists. "Baxter's Call,"
and "Alleine's Alarm," so accorded with his own
ideas of fidelity and unction, that wherever he recognized
their spirit he acknowledged "a brother beloved."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
On this portion of his history we dwell with unspeakable
delight; the only drawback is an undue importance
he appears to have attached to <em>dreams</em>; and even
those, considered as an <em>index</em> to his waking hours, are
interesting, revealing as they do his deep solicitude
on the behalf of souls.</p>

<p>Here then, before he had completed his twenty-first
year, we see Whitefield returned to Gloucester,
and such was already the fame of his piety and talents,
that Dr. Benson, the bishop of the diocese, offered to
dispense, in his favor, with the rule which forbids the
ordination of deacons at so unripe an age. Thus
graphically did he afterwards describe his acceptance
of this proposal.</p>

<p>"I never prayed against any corruption I had in
my life so much as I did against going into holy
orders so soon as my friends were for having me go.
Bishop Benson was pleased to honor me with peculiar
friendship, so as to offer me preferment, or to do
any thing for me. My friends wanted me to mount
the church betimes. They wanted me to knock my
head against the pulpit too young; but how some
young men stand up here and there and preach, I do
not know. However it be to them, God knows how
deep a concern entering into the ministry and preaching
was to me. I prayed a thousand times, till the
sweat has dropped from my face like rain, that God
of his infinite mercy would not let me enter the church
till he called me and thrust me forth in his work. I
remember once in Gloucester&mdash;I know the room; I
look up to the window when I am there and walk
along the street&mdash;I said, 'Lord, I cannot go; I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be puffed up with pride, and fall into the condemnation
of the devil. Lord, do not let me go yet.' I pleaded
to be at Oxford two or three years more. I intended
to make one hundred and fifty sermons, and thought
that I would set up with a good stock in trade. I
remember praying, wrestling, and striving with God.
I said, 'I am undone, I am unfit to preach in thy great
name. Send me not. Lord, send me not yet.' I
wrote to all my friends in town and country to pray
against the bishop's solicitation; but they insisted I
should go into orders before I was twenty-two. After
all their solicitations these words came into my mind:
'Nothing shall pluck you out of my hands;' they came
warm to my heart. Then, and not till then, I said,
'Lord, <em>I will go</em>; send me when thou wilt.'"</p>

<p>Sunday, June 20, 1736, was the day appointed for
his ordination in the cathedral at Gloucester. On
the preceding evening he spent two hours in prayer
for himself and the others who were to be set apart
to the sacred office with him; and on the day itself
he rose early, and passed the morning in prayer and
meditation on the qualifications and duties of the office
he was about to undertake. On a review of the solemn
services of the day, he says, "I trust I answered
every question from the bottom of my heart, and heartily
prayed that God might say, Amen. And when
the bishop laid his hands upon my head, if my vile
heart do not deceive me, I offered my whole spirit,
soul, and body to the service of God's sanctuary.
Let come what will, life or death, depth or height,
I shall henceforward live like one who this day, in the
presence of men and angels, took the holy sacrament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on the profession of being inwardly moved by the
Holy Ghost to take upon me that ministration in the
church. I call heaven and earth to witness, that
when the bishop laid his hands upon me, I gave myself
up to be a martyr for Him who hung upon the
cross for me. Known unto him are all future events
and contingencies; I have thrown myself blindfold,
and I trust without reserve, into his almighty hands.
When I went up to the altar, I could think of nothing
but Samuel's standing before the Lord with a linen
ephod."</p>

<p>Having thus received ordination as a deacon of
the church of England, he delayed not to enter upon
the work to which he was appointed; and accordingly,
on the next Sabbath he preached his first sermon
in his native city of Gloucester, selecting for his subject,
"The necessity and benefit of religious society."
At the appointed time he ascended the pulpit, in the
church of St. Mary de Crypt. We have his own
record of the service: "Last Sunday, in the afternoon,
I preached my first sermon in the church where I first
received the Lord's supper. Curiosity drew a large
congregation together. The sight, at first, a little
awed me; but I was comforted with a heartfelt sense
of the divine presence, and soon found the advantage
of having been accustomed to public speaking when
a boy at school, and of exhorting and teaching the
prisoners and the poor people at their private houses,
while at the university. By these means I was kept
from being daunted overmuch. As I proceeded, I
perceived the fire kindled, till at last, though so young,
and amidst a crowd of those who knew me in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
childish days, I trust I was enabled to speak with
some degree of gospel authority. Some few mocked,
but most, for the present, seemed struck; and I have
since heard that a complaint was made to the bishop,
that I drove fifteen people mad the first sermon. The
worthy prelate, as I am informed, wished that the
madness might not be forgotten before the next Sunday.
Before then, I hope that my sermon upon, 'He
that is in Christ is a new creature,' will be completed.
Blessed be God, I now find freedom in writing. Glorious
Jesus,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'Unloose my stammering tongue to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy love immense, unsearchable.'"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>It is remarkable, under all the circumstances of
the case, that Bishop Benson, a man never distinguished
for his evangelical views, always showed his
friendship for Whitefield. Not only did he offer him
ordination when others might have refused, and defend
him against the persecutions to which he was exposed,
but he more than once gave him pecuniary help when
it was much needed, though the young clergyman had
never complained.</p>

<p>Thus early apprized of the secret of his strength,
his profound aspirations for the growth of Christianity,
the delight of exercising his rare powers, and the
popular admiration, operating with combined and
ceaseless force upon a mind impatient of repose, urged
him into exertions which, if not attested by irrefragable
proofs, might appear incredible. It was the
statement of one who knew him well, and who was
incapable of wilful exaggeration, and it is confirmed
by his letters, journals, and a "cloud of witnesses,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that "in the compass of a single week, and that for
years, he spoke in general forty hours, and in very
many sixty, and that to thousands: and after his
labors, instead of taking any rest, he was engaged in
offering up prayers and intercessions, with hymns and
spiritual songs, as his manner was, in every house to
which he was invited." Never perhaps, since the
apostolic age, has any man given himself so entirely
to preaching the gospel of Christ for the salvation of
souls, adopting as his motto the language of the apostle
Paul, "<em>This one thing I do</em>."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>WHITEFIELD'S SUCCESS AS A PREACHER IN ENGLAND&mdash;FIRST
VISIT TO AMERICA.<br />

1736-1738.</h3>


<p>Whitefield, though thus prepared for action, was
not impatient, but willing to wait till his duty was
fully ascertained. On the Wednesday after his first
sermon he went to Oxford, where, he says, "I was
received with great joy by my religious friends. For
about a week I continued in my servitor's habit, and
then took my degree of Bachelor of Arts, after having
been at the university three years and three quarters,
and going on towards the twenty-second year of my
age. My dear and honored friends, the Rev. Messrs.
John and Charles Wesley, being now embarked for
Georgia, and one or two others having taken orders,
the interest of Methodism, as it was then and is now
termed, had visibly declined, and very few of this
reputedly mad way were left at the university. This
somewhat discouraged me at times, but the Lord Jesus
supported my soul, and made me easy by giving me a
strong conviction that I was where he would have me
to be. My degree, I soon found, was of service to
me, as it gave me access to those I could not be
seen with when in an inferior station; and as opportunity
offered, I was enabled to converse with them
about the things which belonged to the kingdom of
God. The subscriptions for the poor prisoners, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
amounted to about forty pounds per annum, were soon
put into my hands; two or three charity schools,
maintained by the Methodists, were under my more
immediate inspection; which, with the time I spent in
following my studies, private retirement, and religious
converse, sweetly filled up the whole of my day, and
kept me from that unaccountable but too common
complaint of having any time hang upon my hands."</p>

<p>The stay of Mr. Whitefield at Oxford, however,
was very short. He says, "By a series of unforeseen,
unexpected, and unsought-for providences, I was called
in a short time from my beloved retirement to take a
journey to the metropolis of England. While I was
an under-graduate, among the religious friends, I was
very intimate with one Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;n, a professed Methodist,
who had lately taken orders, and was curate at
the Tower of London. With him, when absent, I
frequently corresponded, and when present took sweet
counsel, and walked to the house of God as friends.
He mentioned me to that late good and great man,
Sir John Phillips; and being called down for a while
into Hampshire, he wrote to me to be of good
courage, and in the strength of God bade me hasten
to town to officiate in his absence, and to be refreshed
with the sight and conversation of many who loved
me for Christ's sake, and had for a long time desired
to see me."</p>

<p>On his arrival in London, Whitefield delivered his
first sermon there in Bishopsgate church, on the afternoon
of Lord's day, August 8. On entering the pulpit,
his juvenile aspect excited a general feeling of his
unfitness for the station, but he had not proceeded far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in his sermon before it gave place to universal expressions
of wonder and pleasure. If however he was thus
exposed to the danger of vanity, as he says, "God sent
me something to ballast it. For as I passed along
the streets, many came out of their shops, admiring to
see so young a person in a gown and cassock. One
I remember in particular, cried out, 'There's a boy
parson;' which, as it served to mortify my pride, put
me also upon turning that apostolical exhortation into
prayer, 'Let no man despise thy youth.'" From his
first sermon to his departure, at the end of two months,
his popularity in London continued to increase, and
the crowds were so vast that it was necessary to place
constables both inside and outside of the churches to
preserve the peace. He tells us himself, "Here I continued
for the space of two months, reading prayers
twice a week, catechizing and preaching once, visiting
the soldiers in the infirmary and barracks daily. I also
read prayers every evening at Wapping chapel, and
preached at Ludgate prison every Tuesday. God
was pleased to give me favor in the eyes of the inhabitants
of the Tower; the chapel was crowded on
Lord's days; religious friends from divers parts of
the town attended the word, and several young men
came on Lord's-day morning, under serious impressions,
to hear me discourse about the <em>new birth</em>, and
the necessity of renouncing all in affection in order
to follow Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>The preaching of Mr. Whitefield now excited an
unusual degree of attention among persons of all
ranks. In many of the city churches he proclaimed
the glad tidings of great joy to listening multitudes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who were powerfully affected by the fire which was
displayed in the animated addresses of this man of
God. Lord and Lady Huntingdon constantly attended
wherever he preached, and Lady Anne Frankland
became one of the first-fruits of his ministry
among the nobility of the metropolis. Her ladyship
spent much of her time with Lady Huntingdon, from
whose society and conversation she derived great
comfort. She was a daughter of Richard, the first
Earl of Scarborough; was for many years lady of the
bedchamber to the Princess Anne, and to the Princesses
Amelia and Caroline; and finally became the
second wife of Frederic Frankland, Esq., a member
of Parliament, from whose cruelty she endured much.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have already said, that some time before this
Messrs. John and Charles Wesley had embarked for
Georgia, and to their names we might have added
that of Mr. Ingham, also a member of the Methodist
fraternity at Oxford.</p>

<p>Georgia, which was explored by Sir Walter Raleigh
in 1584, had been colonized by debtors from
Europe, by multitudes who had fled from the grasp of
persecution, and by others who were interested in
constructing a barrier against Spanish aggression.
It originally had trustees in England, concerned for
its interests, including sons of the nobility. The chief
agent in executing the benevolent designs in view
was the truly excellent General Oglethorpe, who admirably
carried out the motto he gave to his companions
in the work, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sibi sed aliis</i>"&mdash;"Not for
themselves, but for others." The children of poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
taken from the overgrown agricultural population,
already a tax upon parish bounty at home, were to
be transferred in large numbers to the silk and indigo
plantations which were established on the savannahs
and bottoms south and west of the river, which thence
derived its name from the peculiar conformation of the
adjoining plains. Combined with these leading purposes,
it was a cherished principle with the early
patrons of this colony, that it should become the centre
for the diffusion of the gospel among the natives;
while charitable foundations were also laid for the
secular and religious education of all who would take
advantage of such provisions. The first Christians
who left Europe to advance the spiritual interests of
Georgia were Moravians, and the next were the Wesleys
and Ingham. The records of the colony, as
quoted in White's Historical Collections of Georgia,
show that, Sept. 14, 1735, Charles Wesley was appointed
"Secretary for the Indian affairs in Georgia,"
and that, Oct. 10, 1735, John Wesley was appointed
"missionary at Savannah."</p>

<p>Whitefield had left London, and was laboring
among a poor and illiterate people in Hampshire,
when his attention was directly drawn to Georgia.
This was not, indeed, the first time his heart had been
interested in the matter. He writes, "When I had
been about a month in town, letters came from the
Messrs. Wesley, and the Rev. Mr. Ingham their fellow-laborer,
an Israelite indeed, from Georgia. Their
accounts fired my soul, and made me long to go abroad
for God too. But having no outward call, and being
as I then thought too weak in body ever to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a voyage at sea, I endeavored to lay aside all thoughts
of going abroad. But my endeavors were all in vain;
for I felt at times such a strong attraction in my soul
towards Georgia, that I thought it almost irresistible.
I strove against it with all my power, begged again
and again, with many cries and tears, that the Lord
would not suffer me to be deluded, and at length
opened my mind to several dear friends. All agreed
that laborers were wanted at home, that I had as yet
no visible call abroad, and that it was my duty not
to be rash, but wait and see what Providence might
point out to me. To this I consented with my whole
heart."</p>

<p>The path of duty, however, soon opened before
him. While fulfilling his duties at Dummer, in Hampshire,
preaching for the Rev. Mr. Kinchin, who was
now absent from home, to which labors we have already
referred, he received an invitation to a lucrative
curacy in London; but Georgia still rested like one
of the prophetic "burdens" on his mind. At this
juncture he received a letter from his clerical friend
at the Tower, saying that Mr. Charles Wesley had
arrived in London. Very soon Mr. Wesley himself
wrote to Whitefield, saying, that he was come
over to procure laborers, "but," added he, "I dare
not prevent God's nomination." "In a few days after
this," writes Mr. Whitefield, "came another letter
from Mr. John Wesley, wherein were these words:
'Only Mr. Delamotte is with me, till God shall stir
up the hearts of some of his servants, who putting
their lives in their hands, shall come over and help
us, where the harvest is so great, and the laborers so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
few. What if thou art the man, Mr. Whitefield?'
In another letter were these words: 'Do you ask me
what you shall have? Food to eat and raiment to
put on, a house to lay your head in&mdash;such as our Lord
had not&mdash;and a crown of glory that fadeth not away.'
Upon reading this my heart leaped within me, and as
it were echoed to the call."</p>

<p>After having consulted his bishop, Dr. Benson, as
also the archbishop of Canterbury, and the trustees
of Georgia including General James Oglethorpe who
was then in London, he went to Bristol, Bath, and
other places, to take leave of his personal friends.
As he could not refrain from preaching, so every sermon
increased his popularity. We give his account
of his preaching at Bristol, as a specimen of the reception
he met with.</p>

<p>"It was wonderful to see how the people hung
upon the rails of the organ-loft, climbed upon the
leads of the church, and made the church itself so hot
with their breath, that the steam would fall from the
pillars like drops of rain. Sometimes almost as many
would go away for want of room as came in, and it
was with great difficulty I got into the desk to read
prayers or preach. Persons of all ranks not only
publicly attended my ministry, but gave me private
invitations to their houses. A private society or two
were erected. I preached and collected for the poor
prisoners in Newgate twice or thrice a week, and
many made me large offers if I would not go abroad."</p>

<p>Having mentioned General James Edward Oglethorpe,
the first governor, and indeed the founder of
the colony of Georgia, and to the end of Whitefield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
life his cordial friend, a few additional facts concerning
him may here be stated. He was the son of Sir
Theophilus Oglethorpe, and was born in London, December
21, 1688. At sixteen he was admitted a student
at Oxford, but did not finish his studies, as the
military profession had more charms for him than
literary pursuits. He was first commissioned as an ensign.
After the death of Queen Anne, he entered into
the service of Prince Eugene. When he attained the
age of twenty-four years, he entered Parliament, for
Haslemere, where he continued thirty-two years. In
November, 1732, Oglethorpe, with one hundred and
sixteen settlers, embarked for Georgia, and landed at
Charleston, S. C., January 13, 1733. They shortly
afterwards proceeded to Georgia, where Oglethorpe
laid out a town, and called it Savannah. He very
happily secured the good will of the Indians. In
1743, he left Georgia for England, to answer charges
brought against him by Lieutenant-colonel Cook. A
court martial declared the charges groundless and
malicious, and Cook was dismissed from the service.
In 1744 he was appointed one of the field-officers
under field-marshal the Earl of Stair, to oppose the
expected invasion of France. He died in 1785. He
was truly a noble man.</p>

<p>As the period approached when Whitefield was to
leave England, the people showed their esteem for
him in almost every possible way. They followed
him so closely, and in such numbers, for holy counsels,
that he could scarcely command a moment for retirement.
They begged to receive from him religious
books, and to have their names written therein with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
his own hand, as memorials of him, and very many
followed him from place to place till his final embarkation.</p>

<p>It was indeed a surprising fact, that a young man,
scarcely more than twenty-two years of age, and previously
unknown to the world, should be able to collect
such immense congregations, and rouse and command
their attention; multitudes hanging upon and
receiving instructions from his lips. But God had
endowed him with a singular union of qualities, which
most eminently fitted him for the work of an evangelist.
He was faithful to his trust, and his divine Master
abundantly blessed and honored him in the discharge
of its momentous duties.</p>

<p>We have now traced the amazing effects of Whitefield's
<em>first</em> sermons, and it may be interesting briefly
to inquire into their general character, and to ascertain
what truths thus aroused the public mind. Three
of these sermons can, happily, be identified with these
"times of refreshing;" and they may be depended on,
as specimens of both the letter and the spirit of his
preaching, because they were printed from his own
manuscripts: they are those on "<cite>Early Piety</cite>," "<cite>Regeneration</cite>,"
and "<cite>Intercession</cite>." Whoever will read
the appeals in these sermons, realizing the circumstances
under which they were made, will scarcely
wonder at the effect produced by them. The topics
of the second and third, and the tone of all the three,
are very different from the matter and manner of sermonizing
then known to the masses of the people.
They do not surprise <em>us</em>, because happily neither the
topics nor the tone of them are "strange things to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ears." Both, however, were novelties in those days,
even in London. When or where had an appeal been
made like this?</p>

<p>"I beseech you, in love and compassion, to come
to Jesus. Indeed, all I say is in love to your souls.
And if I could be but an instrument of bringing you
to Jesus, I should not envy, but rejoice in your happiness,
however much you were exalted. If I was to
make up the <em>last</em> of the train of the companions of the
blessed Jesus, it would rejoice me to see you above
me in glory. I could willingly go to prison or to
death for you, so I could but bring one soul from the
devil's strong-holds, into the salvation which is by
Christ Jesus. Come then to Christ, every one that
hears me this night. Come, come, my guilty brethren;
I beseech you, for your immortal souls' sake, for
Christ's sake, come to Christ. Methinks I could
speak till midnight unto you. Would you have me
go and tell my Master that you will not come, and
that I have spent my strength in vain? I cannot bear
to carry such a message to him. I would not, indeed,
I would not be a swift witness against you at the
great day of account; but if you will refuse these
gracious invitations, I must do it."</p>

<p>In this spirit, not very prevalent even now, Whitefield
began his ministry. There is a fascination as
well as fervor, or rather a fascination arising from
fervor, in some of his earliest as well as his later discourses.
How bold and beautiful is the peroration of
that on "<em>Intercession</em>." Referring to the holy impatience
of "the souls under the altar," for the coming
of the kingdom of God, he exclaims,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"And shall not we who are on earth be often
exercised in this divine employ with the glorious company
of the spirits of just men made perfect? Since
our happiness is so much to consist in the communion
of saints in the church triumphant above, shall we not
frequently intercede for the church militant below,
and earnestly beg that we may be all one? To provoke
you to this work and labor of love, remember,
that it is the never-ceasing employment of the holy
and highly exalted Jesus himself; so that he who is
constantly interceding for others, is doing that on
earth which the eternal Son of God is always doing
in heaven. Imagine, therefore, when you are lifting
up holy hands for one another, that you see the heavens
opened, and the Son of God in all his glory, as
the great High-priest of your salvation, pleading for
you the all-sufficient merit of his sacrifice before the
throne. Join your intercession with his. The imagination
will strengthen your faith, and excite a holy
earnestness in your prayers."</p>

<p>The nearer the time approached for his leaving
the country, the more affectionate the people grew
towards him, and the more eagerly did they attend on
his ministry. Many thousands of ardent petitions
were presented to heaven on behalf of his person and
his ministry; and multitudes would stop him in the
aisles of the churches, or follow him with their tearful
looks. Most of all was it difficult for him to part
from his friends at St. Dunstan's, where he administered
the sacrament, after spending the night before
in prayer.</p>

<p>The man who had produced these extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
effects, says Dr. Gillies, had many natural advantages.
He was something above the middle stature, well proportioned,
though at that time slender, and remarkable
for native gracefulness of manner. His complexion
was very fair, his features regular, his eyes
small and lively, of a dark blue color: in recovering
from the measles, he had contracted a squint with one
of them; but this peculiarity rather rendered the expression
of his countenance more rememberable, than
in any degree lessened the effect of its uncommon
sweetness. His voice excelled both in melody and
compass, and its fine modulations were happily accompanied
by the grace of action which he possessed in
an eminent degree, and which is said to be the chief
requisite of an orator. An ignorant man described
his eloquence oddly, but strikingly, when he said that
Mr. Whitefield preached like a lion. So strange a
comparison conveyed no unapt idea of the force, and
vehemence, and passion&mdash;of the authority which awed
the hearers, and made them tremble like Felix before
the apostle. Believing himself to be the messenger of
God, commissioned to call sinners to repentance, he
spoke as one conscious of his high credentials, with
authority and power; yet in all his discourses there
was a fervor and melting charity, an earnestness of
persuasion, an outpouring of redundant love, partaking
of the virtue of the faith from which it flowed,
insomuch that it seemed to enter the heart which it
pierced, and to heal it as with a balm.</p>

<p>At length, having preached in a considerable number
of the London churches, collected about a thousand
pounds for the charity schools, and obtained upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of three hundred pounds for the poor in Georgia,
Whitefield left London, December 28, 1737, in
the twenty-third of his age, and went in the strength
of God, as a poor pilgrim, on board the Whitaker.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he entered on his voyage from London,
when he discovered that but little comfort was
to be expected in the ship on which he had embarked.
There was no place for retirement, no disposition to
receive him as an ambassador of Christ, and a decided
dislike even to the forms of religion. They moved
but slowly to the Downs, where they were detained
for nearly a month, and where Whitefield went on
shore to visit Deal, an ancient town, one of the Cinque-ports,
so called, where "the common people," as in
the case of his great Master, "heard him gladly."
With him, through his whole ministry, it was of small
importance whether he preached to the rich or the
poor; for he viewed the gospel as a message of mercy
to <em>sinners</em>, and wherever men were found, he was willing
to persuade them to be reconciled to God.</p>

<p>The account given by Mr. Whitefield of his visit
to Deal, and of the different treatment he received
there from different persons, would be almost as correct
a description of his labors and reception in a
hundred other places. He spent his first evening
very comfortably in religious conversation and family
prayer, at which a poor woman was much affected.
"Who knows," he says, "what a fire this little spark
may kindle?" Next evening, eight or nine poor people
came to him at the report of this poor woman;
and when, after three or four days, the ship in which
he had embarked was driven back to Deal, many met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
together to bewail their own sins and those of others.
Soon the landlady who owned the house where he
lodged, sent to her tenants, beseeching them not to
let any more persons come in, for fear the floor should
break under them; and they actually put a prop under
it.</p>

<p>The minister of Upper Deal, a mile or two from
the town, now invited Whitefield to preach in the
church; it was much crowded, and many went away
for want of room. Some stood on the leads of the
building outside, and looked in at the top windows,
and all around seemed eager to hear the word. "May
the Lord," says the good man, "make them <em>doers</em> of it.
In the evening I was obliged to divide my hearers
into four companies, and was enabled to expound to
them from six till ten. Lord, keep me from being
weary of, or in well-doing."</p>

<p>The excitement at Deal became very great, in consequence
of the conviction of the people that their
own minister, the Rev. Dr. Carter, did not preach the
gospel. The good man, to disprove the charge, published
a volume of his sermons, which, however admired
by gay formalists, furnished but too much evidence
of the justice of the charge.</p>

<p>Just as he had left the church at Upper Deal,
where he had been preaching to a vast congregation,
Mr. Whitefield, in consequence of a sudden change of
the wind, was summoned on board, and the Whitaker
sailed for Georgia. A very few hours afterwards,
the vessel which brought back John Wesley from that
colony anchored in the Downs, when he learned that
the ships had passed each other, but neither of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
remarkable men then knew how dear a friend was on
board the other. When Wesley landed, he found it
was still possible to communicate with his friend, and
Whitefield was surprised to receive a letter from him,
saying, "When I saw God by the wind which was
carrying you out brought me in, I asked counsel of
God. His answer you have enclosed." The enclosure
was a slip of paper with the words, "Let him
return to London," which Wesley had obtained by
lot, to which he had had recourse. Whitefield prayed
for direction, and went on his voyage.</p>

<p>This first voyage of Whitefield to America was invested
with scenes of far more than common interest.
Perhaps, since the apostle Paul's memorable voyage
to Rome, the ocean had never exhibited a more remarkable
spectacle than that furnished by this ship.
He was but a stripling in his twenty-third year, and
a faint and hesitating homage once on a Sabbath-day,
from a few of the less obdurate sinners among his
hearers, would be all that such a clergyman could
expect from an assemblage of gentlemen, of soldiers
with their wives and families, and the ship's crew.
Yet in the hands of this remarkable youth all became
pliant as a willow. He converted the chief
cabin into a cloister, the deck into a church, and the
steerage into a school-room. He so bore down all
opposition by love, reason, and Scripture, that we
soon see him, at the request of the captain and officers,
with the hearty concurrence of the gentlemen
who were passengers, reading "full public prayers"
to them twice a day in the great cabin, and expounding
every night after the evening prayers, besides daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
reading prayers, and preaching twice a day on deck
to the soldiers and sailors, and increasing the services
on Sundays. In addition to all this, he daily catechized
a company of young soldiers, and engaged in the
same exercise with the women apart by themselves.</p>

<p>Nor did even all this suffice to expend his zeal,
for he commenced a course of expositions on the creed
and ten commandments; and so convinced was he of
the value of catechetical teaching, that on February 3d
he writes, "I began to-night to turn the observations
made on the lessons in the morning into catechetical
questions, and was pleased to hear some of the soldiers
make very apt answers."</p>

<p>Nor were the children forgotten; the Hon. Mr.
Habersham, a personal friend who accompanied him,
assumed their instruction as his department of holy
labor. Mr. Whitefield wrote of him, that he was
"pleased to see Mr. Habersham so active in teaching
the children. He has now many scholars&mdash;may God
bless him."</p>

<p>Friendship for Whitefield had influenced Mr. Habersham
to accompany the young evangelist to Georgia.
Mr. Habersham's friends, at Beverly, in Yorkshire,
where he was born in 1712, were greatly opposed
to his plans, but surely the hand of God directed
them. He presided over the Orphan-house till 1744,
when he entered into a commercial partnership. He
occupied several important stations, till he became
president of the colony in 1769. The proceedings
connected with the revolutionary war more than once
placed him in great difficulties; he did not live to see
its happy results, for in 1775 the state of his health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
compelled him to visit the north, in hope of its renovation.
The change, however, was of no benefit, and
he died at New Brunswick, New Jersey, August 28,
1775. The "Gazette" of the day said of him, "In the
first stations of the province he conducted himself with
ability, honor, and integrity, which gained him the love
and esteem of his fellow-citizens; nor was he less distinguished
in private life by a conscientious discharge
of the social duties, as a tender and affectionate parent,
a sincere and warm friend, and a kind and indulgent
master. Mr. Habersham was married by the
Rev. Mr. Whitefield to Mary Bolton at Bethesda, on
the 26th of December, 1740, by whom he had ten children,
three of whom, sons, survived him, and were
zealous in the cause of American liberty."</p>

<p>In harmony with the solemn duties which Mr.
Whitefield had assumed, he watched over the conduct
of all around him. He tells us that the ship's cook
was awfully addicted to drinking, and when reproved
for this and other sins, he boasted that he would be
wicked till within two years of his death, and would
then reform. Alas, he died on the voyage, after an
illness of six hours, brought on by drinking.</p>

<p>One day on this voyage, finding on Captain Whiting's
pillow "The Independent Whig," Whitefield exchanged
it for a book entitled "The Self-Deceiver."
The next morning, the captain came smiling and inquired
who made the exchange. Mr. Whitefield confessed
the fact, and begged his acceptance of the book,
which he said he had read, and liked very well. From
thenceforward a visible alteration took place in the
conduct of the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>On their arrival at Gibraltar, where they had to
continue some time, Mr. Whitefield found that Major
Sinclair, without solicitation, had provided a lodging
for him, and the governor and military invited him
to their table. Being apprehensive that at a public
military table he might be more than hospitably
treated, to prevent any thing disagreeable, he reminded
his excellency that, at the court of Ahasuerus,
"none did compel." The governor took the hint, and
pleasantly replied, "No compulsion of any kind shall
be used at my table;" and every thing was conducted
with the greatest propriety. Here he often preached,
and was heard by many, including all in high offices.
Unusual indeed were the scenes, both with respect to
the place and the people. The adjacent promontories,
and the vastness of the rock of Gibraltar, aided
in the enlargement of the ideas of the preacher as
to Him, who "in his strength setteth fast the mountains,
and is girded about with power." And the
place being a sort of public rendezvous of all nations,
he thought, he says, "he saw the world in
epitome."</p>

<p>The success of Whitefield's ministry at Gibraltar
was truly remarkable. He quaintly says of it, "Samson's
riddle was fulfilled there: 'out of the strong
came forth sweetness.' Who more unlikely to be
wrought upon than soldiers? And yet, among any
set of people, I have not been where God has made
his power more known. Many that were quite blind,
have received their sight; many that had fallen back,
have repented and turned to the Lord again; many
that were ashamed to own Christ openly, have waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bold; and many saints have had their hearts filled
with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."</p>

<p>Among other religions societies to which Whitefield
was introduced at Gibraltar, he one day attended
the Jewish synagogue, and was agreeably surprised
when one of the rulers handed him into the chief seat.
The rabbi had the day before heard him preach against
profane swearing, and now thanked him for his sermon.
He remained in the synagogue during the whole
service, engaged, he says, "in secret prayer that the
veil might be taken from the heart of the Jews, and
they grafted again into their own olive-tree."</p>

<p>Several facts occurred on the way to Savannah
after their embarkation from Gibraltar, which are too
interesting to pass without notice. On one occasion
Captain Mackay, after Whitefield had preached against
drunkenness, urged the men to attend to the things
which had been spoken; telling them that he was a
notorious swearer until he did so; and beseeching
them for Christ's sake to give up their sins. On
another occasion, while marrying a couple on deck,
Whitefield suddenly shut the prayer-book in the midst
of the ceremony, because the bridegroom had behaved
with levity; and not until the laughter was turned
into weeping, would he proceed. At the close of the
service he gave the bride a Bible. When a shark
was caught, with five pilot-fish clinging to its fins, he
said, "Go to the pilot-fish, thou that forsakest a friend
in adversity; consider his ways, and be abashed."
When a dolphin was caught, the change of its hues
from lovely to livid, reminded him to say, "Just so is
man; he flourishes for a little while, but when death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
cometh, how quickly his beauty is gone! A Christian
may learn instruction from every thing he meets with."
While he was preaching on the death of Christ darkness
came on, and he said, "It puts me in mind of that
darkness which overwhelmed the world when the God
of nature suffered."</p>

<p>In the latter part of the voyage, fever laid prostrate
all in the ship except four persons, and at
length it seized Whitefield, and confined him to his
bed for a week. The attack, though short, must have
been severe; for besides other remedies, he was bled
three times. During his illness, the captain gave up
his own bed to him, and Mr. Habersham watched him
day and night; but that which gratified him most
was, that the sick between decks, whom he had endangered
his life to console, prayed for him with great
fervor. He recovered, and repaid the kindness of all.
At length, on May 5, they came in sight of Savannah
river, and sent off for a pilot; and such was the joy
of all, when they came to anchor at Tybee island, that
he could not help exclaiming, "How infinitely more
joyful will the children of God be, when, having passed
through the waves of this troublesome world, they
arrive at the haven of everlasting rest!" Though
still weak, he preached a farewell sermon to his "red-coated
and blue-jacketed parishioners," as he called
his military and naval congregation. It was heard
with floods of tears.</p>

<p>Upon this voyage, says Dr. Gillies, he made these
reflections many years after: "Even at this distance
of time, the remembrance of the happy hours I enjoyed
in religious exercises on deck, is refreshing to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
soul; and although nature sometimes relented at being
taken from my friends, and I was little accustomed to
the inconveniences of a sea-life, yet, a consciousness
that I had the glory of God and the good of souls in
view, afforded me, from time to time, unspeakable
satisfaction."</p>

<p>Whitefield was cordially welcomed at Savannah
by Delamotte and other friends of the Wesleys: the
magistrates also offered to wait upon him to pay their
respects; but this he declined, and waited upon them.
They agreed to build him a tabernacle and a house at
Frederica, and to accept his services at Savannah as
long as he pleased. He was soon, however, again
laid aside by the return of his fever, now accompanied
with ague. This attack in a few days brought him
so low, and made so great an alteration in his person,
that he says, "Had my friends seen me at that hour,
they might have learned not to have any man's person
in admiration, and not to think more highly of me
than they ought to think."</p>

<p>The first thing which Whitefield did after his recovery
was to visit <em>Tomo-Chici</em>, the Indian king, then
on his death-bed. This was the micoe, or king, whom
Oglethorpe had taken to England, in 1734, and introduced
to king George the Second. He was accompanied
by his wife and son, and seven other Indians
of the Creek nation. His eloquent speech to the
king and queen was so well received at court, that he
was loaded with presents, and when he had again to
embark, was sent in one of the royal carriages to
Gravesend. "He now lay," says Whitefield, "on a
blanket, thin and meagre; little else but skin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
bones. Senanki, his wife, sat by, fanning him with
Indian feathers. There was no one could talk English,
so I could only shake hands with him and leave
him. A few days afterwards, Mr. Whitefield again
went to visit Tomo-Chici, and found that his nephew,
Tooanoowee, could speak English. Whitefield says, "I
desired him to ask his uncle, whether he thought he
should die; who answered, 'I cannot tell.' I then
asked where he thought he should go after death.
He replied, 'To heaven.' But alas, how can a drunkard
enter there? I then exhorted Tooanoowee, who
is a tall, proper youth, not to get drunk; telling him
that he understood English, and therefore would be
punished the more if he did not live better. I then
asked him whether he believed in a heaven. He said,
'Yes.' I then asked whether he believed in a hell,
and described it by pointing to the fire. He replied,
'No.' From whence we may easily gather, how natural
it is to all mankind to believe there is a place of
happiness, because they wish it to be so; and on the
contrary, how averse they are to believe in a place of
torment, because they wish it may not be so. But
God is just and true; and as surely as the righteous
shall go away into everlasting happiness, so the impenitently
wicked shall go into everlasting punishment."</p>

<p>The records of Georgia say, under date of December
21, 1737, "Ordered, that a license be made out
for the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield to perform ecclesiastical
offices in Georgia, as a deacon in the church
of England."</p>

<p>Before Whitefield had any thoughts of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
abroad, Charles Wesley talked to him of an orphan-house
in Georgia, which he and General Oglethorpe
had contemplated. When he arrived in Savannah,
and had sufficiently recovered from his illness to
examine the state of the colony, the condition of the
children deeply affected him; and he set his heart on
founding the projected institution as soon as he should
be able to collect the needful funds. In the mean
time he opened schools in the villages of Highgate
and Hampstead, and one also, for girls, in Savannah.
He afterwards visited the Saltzburgher's orphan-school
at Ebenezer; and if any thing had been wanted
to settle his own determination, or to inflame his
zeal, he found it there. The Saltzburghers were exiles
for conscience' sake, and were eminent for piety
and industry. Their ministers, the Rev. Messrs. Grenaw
and Boltzius, were eminently evangelical, and
their asylum, which they had been enabled to found
by British benevolence, for widows and orphans, was
flourishing. Whitefield was so delighted with the
order and harmony of Ebenezer, that he gave a share
of his own "poor's store" to Boltzius, for his orphans.
Then came the scene which entirely completed his
purpose: Boltzius "called all the children before him;
catechized and exhorted them to give God thanks for
his good providence towards them; then prayed with
them, and made them pray after him; then sung a
psalm. Afterwards, the little lambs came and shook
me by the hand, one by one, and so we parted."
Whitefield was now pledged to this cause for life.</p>

<p>Most of our readers probably know that the conductors
of "The Gentleman's Magazine," a work which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
has now been regularly published in London for much
more than a century, have never been favorable to
evangelical truth, or its ministers; it is therefore the
more gratifying to copy from that work for November,
1737, the following lines: it will be seen that
they were published more than a month before Mr.
Whitefield's departure to the American colonies.</p>

</div></div>

<p>After spending a few weeks at Savannah, laboring
as much as his health would permit, Whitefield went
to Frederica, where he was gladly received; the people
"having had a famine of the word for a long season."
They had no sanctuary, and therefore he had
to preach under a tree, or in Mr. Habersham's house.
This visit, although short, endeared him to all the
people; and he had the satisfaction before he left, to
see them "sawing timber for a commodious place of
worship, until a church could be built." His return,
however, to Savannah was hastened by a somewhat
painful event. One of his friends was lost in the
woods, and missing from Tuesday till Friday. The
great guns had been fired to direct the wanderer, but
in vain; and some of the people had searched for him
day and night, without success. This report was sent
to Whitefield, and it hurried him away from Frederica.
He had the pleasure, however, on his arrival at Savannah,
to find his "lost sheep."</p>

<p>During the stay of Whitefield in Georgia, the
weather was intensely hot, sometimes almost burning
his feet through his shoes. Seeing others do it, he
determined to accustom himself to hardship by lying
constantly on the floor; which by use he found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
so far from being uncomfortable, that afterwards it
became so to lie on a bed. Nor was he more ready
to deny himself than he was assiduous to do good;
preaching often, catechizing the young, visiting the
sick, and exhorting from house to house. Entirely
independent and unrestrained, he knew no fear in the
discharge of what he regarded as his duty. Knowing
that some men of influence, to whom his voice could
not be addressed from the pulpit, were living in open
defiance of morality and shame, he went into the
court and made an address to the grand jury, urging
them to present all such offenders without partiality
or fear, since the miserable state of the colony was
doubtless owing to divine displeasure against their
sins.</p>

<p>Reflection on the character, labors, and success of
his predecessors, stimulated his zeal and encouraged
his hope. It could not be denied that John Wesley
had been misrepresented and unkindly treated, both
in Savannah and Frederica, and Whitefield therefore
rejoiced to bear honorable testimony of him and his
colleagues. He says, "Surely I must labor most
heartily, since I come after such worthy men. The
good Mr. John Wesley has done in America is inexpressible.
His name is very precious among the people,
and he has laid such a foundation, that I hope
neither men nor devils will be able to shake it. O
that I may follow him as he has followed Christ."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield having as yet only received deacon's
orders, and wishing to be ordained priest, for
the more complete performance of his duty as a minister
of the church of England, it became necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for him to return to Europe for that purpose; and
being also desirous of making collections for his Orphan-house,
he left Mr. Habersham at Savannah, and
went to Charleston, S. C., on his way to England.</p>

<p>At Charleston he became acquainted with the Rev.
Alexander Garden, the ecclesiastical commissary of
the Bishop of London, who with apparent cordiality
twice invited him into his pulpit, and assured him
that he would defend him with his life and property,
should the same arbitrary proceedings ever be commenced
against him which Mr. Wesley had met with
in Georgia. Dr. Deems, in his recently published
volume, "The Annals of Southern Methodism," tells
us, when speaking of his first sermon, "The people at
first despised his youth, but his engaging address soon
gained their general esteem, and Mr. Garden thanked
him most cordially." In an after-period, however,
when Mr. Garden more fully understood the evangelical
character of Mr. Whitefield's preaching, he
frequently took occasion to point out what he called
the pernicious tendency of his doctrines, and irregular
manner of life. He represented him as a religious
quack, who had an excellent way of setting off and
rendering palatable his poisonous tenets. On one
occasion Garden, to keep his flock from going after
this strange pastor, preached from the text, "These
that have turned the world upside down are come
hither also." Whitefield, however, was not to be
silenced in this way, and returned the compliment by
preaching from the words, "Alexander the coppersmith
did me much evil; the Lord reward him according
to his works."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>On September 6, 1738, Whitefield embarked for
London. The voyage was perilous in the extreme.
They were tossed about with bad weather, in a ship
out of repair, and in sad want of provisions. When
they were over about one-third of the Atlantic, a vessel
from Jamaica would have gladly received him,
but he chose to share the lot of his shipmates. They
highly valued his services, and one of his fellow-passengers,
Captain Gladman, became, as the result of
this voyage, a truly pious man. The captain, in a
subsequent period, at his own earnest request, became
the fellow-traveller of his teacher.</p>

<p>After a passage of about nine weeks, they made
the port of Limerick, in Ireland. "I wish," Whitefield
says, "I could never forget what I felt when
water and provisions were brought us from the shore.
Mr. M'Mahon, a country gentleman, came from his
seat at midnight on purpose to relieve us, and most
kindly invited me, though unknown, to his house, to
stay as long as I pleased." At Limerick he was cordially
received by that worthy prelate, Bishop Birscough,
who engaged him to preach at the cathedral.
From thence he went to Dublin, where he preached,
and was hospitably entertained by Archbishop Bolton,
Bishop Rundel, and Dr. Delany.</p>

<p>Remaining but a short time in Ireland, he proceeded
to London, where he arrived December 8.
Here he had the pleasure of conversing with some of
the Moravian brethren, whose faith and love refreshed
his spirit, though he did not entirely approve some
of their views. He soon discovered somewhat of a
change of feeling towards him on the part of many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the London clergy. Within two days, he found five
of the churches were closed against him. He called
on the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of
London, who received him with cold civility. The
bishop asked him if his journals were not tinctured
with enthusiasm; and he replied, with his usual meekness
and candor, that they were written only for his
own use, and that of his private friends, and that they
were published without his knowledge. So anxious
was he to avoid giving offence, that he took the earliest
opportunity to expunge from his journals whatever
he discovered to be erroneous, and whatever he
had said without imperative necessity, or which was
likely to injure the character and feelings of any one.</p>

<p>The trustees of Georgia, at a meeting in London,
received Whitefield with great cordiality, and in compliance
with the wishes of the colonists, they presented
him with the living of Savannah, the salary of which
he declined to receive; but he thankfully accepted
five hundred acres of land, on which he proposed to
erect his orphan-house.</p>

<p>On Sunday, January 14, 1739, being then in his
twenty-fifth year, Whitefield was ordained priest at
Oxford, by his worthy friend Bishop Benson. Having
preached twice to very crowded congregations,
and administered the Lord's supper at the castle, he
returned to London the next day. As Dr. Benson
once expressed regret that he had ordained Mr.
Whitefield, it may be proper here to explain the circumstances.
Shortly after the late Countess of Huntingdon
first became acquainted with the truth as it
is in Jesus, Bishop Benson, who had been lord Huntingdon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tutor, was sent for to remonstrate with her
ladyship, and to induce her to relinquish what were
then considered her erroneous views; but she pressed
him so hard with the Articles and Homilies of his own
church, and so plainly and faithfully urged upon him
the awful responsibility of his station, that for the
moment his mind was hurt, and he rose up to depart,
lamenting that he had ever laid his hands upon George
Whitefield, to whom he imputed the change which had
been wrought in her ladyship. "My lord," said she,
"mark my words; when you come upon your dying
bed, that will be one of the few ordinations you will
reflect upon with pleasure." It would seem that it
was so; for, on his death-bed, the Bishop sent ten
guineas to Mr. Whitefield as a token of his favor and
approbation, and begged to be remembered by him in
his prayers.</p>

<p>The interval between his taking priests' orders,
and embarking a second time for Georgia, was employed
by Whitefield, with his usual energy and success,
in preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
and in making collections for his Orphan-house. Having,
before his visit to America, collected large sums
for the charity schools in the metropolis, he naturally
expected that the pulpits would not be denied him
now, in which to plead the interests of his own poor.
But he was scarcely yet aware that the tide of clerical
opinion had turned so extensively and strongly
against him. The doctrines he had preached, and the
manner in which he had preached them, had produced
a sensation so strong, that he found himself excluded
from most of the churches in London. A few, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were yet open to him for his benevolent design.
The Rev. Mr. Broughton conducted himself, among
others, very nobly. Having been urged to refuse his
pulpit, as some of his neighbors had done, he boldly
replied, that "having obtained the lectureship of St.
Helen's by Whitefield's influence, he should have the
pulpit if he desired it." Mr. Whitefield preached,
but Mr. Broughton thus losing the lectureship, Whitefield
blamed himself for having done so. Whatever
he might himself be willing to suffer, he was not willing
to inflict inconvenience on others.</p>

<p>Only a few days before his being ordained as
priest, Whitefield offered his first public <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i>
prayer, in a large meeting in Red Cross-street, London.
He mentions this fact in a note of his diary as
"the first time I ever prayed extempore before such
a number." He did not even then suppose that his
preaching, as well as his prayers in this manner, were
to develop his mighty power. The crowding of the
churches now suggested the idea of preaching in the
open air. He says, "When I was informed that
nearly a thousand people stood out in the church-yard,
and that hundreds returned home, this put me
first upon thinking of preaching without doors. I
mentioned it to some friends, who looked upon it as a
<em>mad</em> motion. However, we kneeled down and prayed
that nothing might be done rashly. Hear and answer,
O Lord, for thy name's sake."</p>

<p>We shall soon see how his extempore expositions
and prayers were fitting him for this new enterprise.
He would have commenced in London now, but he
lacked a fair opportunity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>OPEN-AIR PREACHING IN ENGLAND AND WALES&mdash;ERECTION
OF THE TABERNACLE IN LONDON.<br />

1738-1739.</h3>


<p>Under the circumstances we have related in our
last chapter, Whitefield paid another visit to Bristol,
and soon found that he had to meet with new and
very unexpected opposition. When he arrived in the
city, the chancellor of the diocese, while he did not
approve of what he considered his irregular conduct,
told him that he would not prohibit any clergyman
from lending him his church; but in a few days afterwards
he sent for the evangelist, and announced
his entire opposition to his movements. Strangely
enough, he now asked Whitefield by what authority
he preached in the diocese of Bristol without a license.
The reply of the intrepid minister was, that he supposed
such a custom had become obsolete, and asked
the chancellor in his turn, "And pray, sir, why did
you not ask the clergyman who preached for you last
Thursday this question?" The chancellor then read
to him the canons which forbid any clergyman from
preaching in a private house; to which Whitefield
replied, that he did not suppose these canons referred
to professed ministers of the church of England; and
when the chancellor told him he was mistaken, he
reminded his superior, "There is also a canon, sir,
forbidding all clergymen to frequent taverns and play
at cards; why is not that put in execution?" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
he then added, that notwithstanding any canons to
the contrary, he could not but speak the things which
he knew, and that he was resolved to proceed as usual.
His answer was written down, and the chancellor
closed the interview with the words, "I am resolved,
sir, if you preach or expound anywhere in this diocese
till you have a license, I will first suspend, and
then excommunicate you." The crisis was now come;
the Rubicon had been passed, and the inquiry might
well be made, "What will Whitefield now do?"</p>

<p>Already have we seen that he had earnestly desired,
in London, to preach in the open air, for want
of room in the churches, and indeed also from the
opposition of the clergy, which had begun so strongly
to manifest itself; and during this journey to Bristol,
he found it necessary to preach in the open air or not
at all. As this event was of vast importance in its
results, both in his own history and that of Mr. Wesley,
who also began to preach on the same spot within
two months after Whitefield had opened the way, we
must stay a while to narrate the facts.</p>

</div>

<p>At that time, the colliers of Kingswood, near the
city of Bristol, were a most depraved and reckless
class of men. Inconceivably barbarous and ignorant,
they trampled on all laws, human and divine, and
hesitated not to set the magistrates at defiance. It
was dangerous to pass near the scene of their labors,
even in open day, for robberies and murders were of
frequent occurrence; in a word, it was truly "a seat
of Satan." When Whitefield was at Bristol, making
collections for his projected orphan institution in
Georgia, not a few persons had said to him, "Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
go abroad; have we not Indians enough at home?
If you have a mind to convert Indians, there are colliers
enough in Kingswood." "I thought," says he,
"it might be doing the service of my Creator, who
had a mountain for his pulpit, and the heavens for his
sounding-board, and who, when his gospel was refused
by the Jews, sent his servants into the highways and
hedges." After much prayer and many inward struggles,
he went one day to a gentle elevation on the
south side of Kingswood, called Hanham Mount, and
there, under an old sycamore-tree, he preached his
first sermon in the open air to about a hundred colliers.
The scene must have been very impressive.
Before him stretched the rich and beautiful valley of
the Avon, through which the river was gently winding,
bordered in the distance by the undulating hills;
while on his right and left the cities of Bath and
Bristol were within sight.</p>

<p>The fact of his preaching here soon and extensively
spread, and at meeting after meeting his audience increased,
till he found himself addressing <em>nearly twenty
thousand persons</em>. His own account of the effects produced
is very striking. He says, "The first discovery
of their being affected, was in the white gutters made
by their tears, which plentifully fell down their black
cheeks, as they came out of their coal pits. Hundreds
and hundreds of them were soon brought under deep
convictions, which happily ended in sound and thorough
conversion. As the scene was quite new, and
I had just begun to be an extempore preacher, I had
often many inward conflicts. Sometimes, when twenty
thousand people were before me, I had not, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
thought, a word to say; but I was never deserted;
and I was often so assisted as to understand what
that meaneth, 'Out of his belly shall flow rivers of
living water.' The open firmament above; the prospect
of the adjacent fields; with the sight of thousands
and thousands, some in coaches, some on horseback,
and some in the trees, and all so affected as to be
drenched in tears together, to which sometimes was
added the solemnity of the approaching night, were
almost too much for me; I was occasionally all but
overcome." Writing to Mr. Wesley a few weeks
afterwards, he says, "Yesterday I began to play the
madman in Gloucestershire, by preaching on a table
in Thornbury-street. To-day I have exhorted twice,
and by and by I shall begin a third time; nothing
like doing good by the way. I suppose you have
heard of my proceedings in Kingswood."</p>

<p>We scarcely need to remark here, that Kingswood
has ever since been regarded as a sacred spot in ecclesiastical
history. Here houses for Wesleyan Methodists
and Independents were soon erected, and in
them thousands have been converted to God. Here
was placed the first school for the sons of Methodist
preachers, and on Hanham Mount, besides the voice of
Whitefield, those of the Wesleys, Coke and Mather,
Pawson and Benson, and Bradburn, accomplished some
of the mightiest effects which attended their powerful
preaching. There are yet some living in the neighborhood
who were awakened under their ministry, and
whose eyes glisten as they tell of the blessed days that
are past.</p>

<p>Besides the colliers, and thousands from the neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
villages, persons of all ranks daily flocked out
of Bristol. And he was soon invited by many of the
most respectable people to preach on a large bowling-green
in the city itself. Many of the people indeed
sneered to see a stripling with a gown mount a table
on unconsecrated ground; this even excited once or
twice the laugh of some of the higher ranks, who had
admired him in the churches. But he was unmoved,
and his preaching was so blessed, that many were
awakened. Sometimes he was employed almost from
morning till night answering those who, in distress of
soul, cried out, "What shall I do to be saved?" He
now sought the help of Mr. John Wesley, who, after
much reasoning with himself on the subject, complied
with the invitation, and followed Whitefield's example,
who immediately committed the work to him.
Before leaving the neighborhood, however, Whitefield
had the satisfaction of laying the foundation of
a school for Kingswood; for the support of which the
colliers liberally and cheerfully subscribed.</p>

<p>Taking an affectionate leave of his Bristol friends,
Whitefield made an excursion into Wales, where a
revival of religion had commenced several years before,
under the ministry of the Rev. Griffith Jones,
and was now carried on by the ministry of Mr. Howel
Harris, a man of strong mental powers, great Christian
zeal, and considerable learning. They met at Cardiff.
Whitefield's heart was then glowing with the fire he
had himself kindled at Bristol and Kingswood. On
his way from Bristol to Cardiff, he was delayed at the
New Passage by contrary winds. He says, "At the
inn there was an unhappy clergyman who would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
go over in the passage-boat, because I was in it. Alas,
thought I, this very temper would make heaven itself
unpleasant to that man, if he saw me there. I was
told that he charged me with being a dissenter. I
saw him, soon after, shaking his elbows over a gaming-table.
I heartily wish those who charge me causelessly
with schism and being righteous overmuch,
would consider that the canons of our church forbid
the clergy to frequent taverns, or to play at cards or
dice, or any other unlawful games. Their indulging
themselves in these things is a stumbling-block to
thousands."</p>

<p>We have said that Whitefield first met Howel
Harris at Cardiff. After preaching in the town-hall,
from the judges' seat, he says, "I was much refreshed
with the sight of Mr. Howel Harris; whom, though
I knew not in person, I have long loved, and have
often felt my soul drawn out in prayer in his behalf....
When I first saw him, my heart was knit closely to
him. I wanted to catch some of his fire, and gave
him the right hand of fellowship with my whole heart.
After I had saluted him, and given an exhortation to
a great number of people, who followed me to the inn,
we spent the remainder of the evening in taking sweet
counsel together, and telling one another what God
had done for our souls. A divine and strong sympathy
seemed to be between us, and I was resolved to
promote his interest with all my might. Accordingly
we took an account of the several societies, and agreed
on such measures as seemed most conducive to promote
the common interest of our Lord. Blessed be
God, there seems a noble spirit gone out into Wales;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and I believe that, ere long, there will be more visible
fruits of it. What inclines me strongly to think so
is, that the partition wall of bigotry and party spirit
is broken down, and ministers and teachers of different
communions join, with one heart and one mind, to
carry on the kingdom of Jesus Christ. The Lord
make all the Christian world thus minded; for, until
this is done, we must, I fear, despair of any great
reformation in the church of God."</p>

<p>Before leaving Cardiff, Whitefield preached again
in the town-hall, to a large assembly. He says, "My
dear brother Harris sat close by me. I did not observe
any scoffers within; but without, some were
pleased to honor me so far as to trail a dead fox, and
hunt it about the hall. But, blessed be God, my voice
prevailed. This being done, I went, with many of my
hearers, among whom were two worthy dissenting
ministers, to public worship; and in the second lesson
were these remarkable words: 'The high-priests,
and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to
destroy him; but they could not find what they might
do to him; for all the people were very attentive to
hear him.'</p>

<p>"In the afternoon I preached again, without any
disturbance or scoffing. In the evening, I talked for
above an hour and a half with the religious society,
and never did I see a congregation more melted
down. The love of Jesus touched them to the quick.
Most of them were dissolved in tears. They came to
me after, weeping, bidding me farewell, and wishing I
could continue with them longer. Thanks be to God,
for such an entrance into Wales. I wrestled with God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for them in prayer, and blessed be His holy name for
sending me into Wales. I hope these are the first-fruits
of a greater harvest, if ever it should please
God to bring me back from Georgia. 'Father, thy
will be done.'"</p>

<p>Whitefield returned from this short excursion, to
Bristol, baptized with Welsh fire, and renewed his
labors among the Kingswood colliers with more than
his usual power and success. He could not, however,
forget the tears which had entreated him to stay longer
in Wales, and in three or four weeks he visited
Usk and Pontypool, where he was again met by Howel
Harris. At Usk, "the pulpit being denied, I preached
upon a table, under a large tree, to some hundreds,
and God was with us of a truth. On my way to Pontypool,
I was informed by a man who heard it, that
Counsellor H&mdash;&mdash; did me the honor to make a public
motion to Judge P&mdash;&mdash; to stop me and brother Howel
Harris from going about teaching the people. Poor
man, he put me in mind of Tertullus, in the Acts; but
my hour is not yet come. I have scarcely begun my
testimony. For my finishing it, my enemies must
have power over me from above. Lord, prepare me
for that hour."</p>

<p>The report to which we have just referred did not
prevent the curate of Pontypool from cordially inviting
Whitefield into his pulpit. He also read prayers
for him. After the sermon, it was found that so many
had come to hear who could not find room in the
church, that another sermon was loudly called for.
He says, "I went and preached to all the people in
the field. I always find I have most power when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
preach in the open air; a proof to me that God is
pleased with this way of preaching. I betook myself
to rest, full of such unutterable peace as no one can
conceive of but those who feel it."</p>

<p>In several other places did our evangelist, during
this excursion, unfurl the banner of the cross; and at
its close he writes, "Oh how swiftly this week has
glided away. To me it has been but as one day.
How do I pity those who complain that time hangs
on their hands! Let them but love Christ, and
spend their whole time in his service, and they will
find but few melancholy hours." Nor will any wonder
that he should thus speak, who consider the spirit
which animated his soul. What he some time afterwards
wrote to Howel Harris, from Philadelphia, indicated
the spirit he himself cherished: "Intersperse
prayers with your exhortations, and thereby call down
fire from heaven, even the fire of the Holy Ghost,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'To soften, sweeten, and refine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And melt them into love.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="noindent">Speak every time, my dear brother, as if it were your
last; <em>weep out</em>, if possible, every argument, and compel
them to cry, 'Behold how he loveth us.'"</div>

<p>From Wales, Whitefield went to visit his native
city, Gloucester; and after one or two sermons, he
found himself here also excluded from the parochial
pulpits. But notwithstanding his persecutions, and
the infirm state of his health at that time, his labors
in Gloucester and its vicinity were constant and eminently
successful. Bowling-greens, market-crosses,
highways, and other such places, bore witness to his
faithful and tearful labors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>At Gloucester lived at that time the Rev. Mr.
Cole, an old dissenting minister, who often heard
Whitefield preach, and used to say, "These are the
days of the Son of man indeed!" Whitefield, when a
boy, had been taught to ridicule this Mr. Cole; and
when he was once asked what profession he would
engage in, replied, "I will be a minister, but I will
take care never to tell stories in the pulpit like old
Cole." Twelve years afterwards, the old minister
heard the young one preach, and tell some story to
illustrate his subject, when the venerable servant of
Christ remarked, "I find young Whitefield can tell
stories now as well as old Cole." The good man
was much affected with the preaching of his young
friend, and was so humble, that he used to subscribe
himself his curate, and went about in the country preaching
after him. One evening, while preaching, he was
struck with death, and asked for a chair to lean on
till he had finished his sermon. Having done this, he
was carried up stairs and died. When the fact was
told to Whitefield, he said, "O blessed God, if it be
thy holy will, may my exit be like his!" How striking
is this fact when looked at in connection with the circumstances
of his own removal from earth.</p>

<p>Intent on the advancement of his orphan-house in
Georgia, Whitefield soon went to London, passing on
his way through Oxford. At both places he found
opposition, and in London was shut out of the churches.
He preached to thousands in Islington churchyard,
and now resolved to give himself to the work in the
open air.</p>

<p>From the conflict with the enemies who a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
years before had threatened her existence, the polemics
of the church of England now turned to resist
the unwelcome ally who menaced her repose. Bishop
Warburton led the van, and behind him many a mitred
front scowled on the audacious innovator. Divested
of the logomachies which chiefly engaged the attention
of the disputants, the controversy between Whitefield
and the bishops lay in a narrow compass. It being
mutually conceded that the virtues of the Christian
life can result only from certain divine impulses, and
that to lay a claim to this holy inspiration when its
legitimate fruits are wanting, is a fatal delusion, he
maintained, and they denied, that the person who is
the subject of this sacred influence has within his own
bosom an independent attestation of its reality. So
abstruse a debate required the zest of some more pungent
ingredients, and the polemics with whom Whitefield
had to do were not such sciolists in their calling
as to be ignorant of the necessity of riveting upon
him some epithet at once opprobrious and vague.
While therefore milder spirits arraigned him as an
<em>enthusiast</em>, Warburton, with constitutional energy of
invective, denounced him as a <em>fanatic</em>. In vain Whitefield
demanded a definition of these reproachful terms.
To have fixed their meaning would have been to blunt
their edge. They afforded a solution, at once compendious,
obscure, and repulsive, of whatever was remarkable
in his character, and have been associated
with his name from that time to the present.</p>

<p>The spots on which Whitefield now began, in his
own language, "to take the field," and publicly to
erect the standard of the Redeemer's cross, are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
known. Moorfields, then a place of general rendezvous
and recreation from the crowded city, Kennington
Common then about two, and Blackheath about five
miles from London, were the favorite sites to which
he loved to resort, and "open his mouth boldly" to
listening thousands, in honor of his crucified and
glorified Lord. Recording his first engagement of
this kind in his diary of Sabbath evening, April 29,
1739, he writes, "Begun to be yet more vile this day,
for I preached at Moorfields to an exceeding great
multitude; and at five in the evening went and preached
at Kennington Common, where upwards of twenty
thousand were supposed to be present. The wind
being for me, it carried my voice to the extreme part
of my audience. All stood attentive, and joined in
the psalm and the Lord's prayer so regularly, that I
scarce ever preached with more quietness in a church.
Many were much affected.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'For this let men revile my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll shun no cross, I'll fear no shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All hail, reproach, and welcome pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Only thy terrors, Lord, restrain.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For several successive months, the places we have
named were his chief scenes of action. At a moderate
computation, the audience frequently consisted of
twenty thousand. It is said that the singing could
be heard two miles, and the voice of the preacher
nearly one. Sometimes there were upwards of a hundred
coaches, besides wagons, scaffolds, and other
contrivances by which a sight of him could be obtained.
The rising ground on Blackheath, from which
Whitefield preached, is still known as "Whitefield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mount," and after his death, Lord Dartmouth planted
it with fir-trees. It will ever be a grateful recollection
to the author of this volume, that during the
summer of 1839 he prevailed on some of the most eminent
ministers of England to preach on every successive
Monday evening on this hallowed spot; and that
here many thousands then heard the way of salvation,
and not a few were brought to the cross of Christ.
In that immediate neighborhood too, now densely
populated, he organized, and for some years preached
to a Christian church. Memorable times! Many
were the manifestations of the Redeemer's favor.</p>

<p>An anecdote which we heard many years ago from
one of Whitefield's Blackheath hearers, may here be
related. While one day preaching on "the heath,"
there passed along the road at some distance, an old
man and "Mary" his wife, with their ass and his
loaded panniers, returning from London to their home
in Kent. Attracted alike by the crowd and the
preacher's voice, the old man and his wife turned a
little out of their way to hear "what the man was
talking about." Whitefield spoke of somewhat which
occurred eighteen hundred years ago, and the old
man said, "Mary, come along, it is only something
which happened a long while ago;" but Mary's attention
had been arrested, and she wished to stay a minute
or two longer. They were both soon in tears,
and the inquiry was excited in their hearts, "What
shall we do to be saved?" On their way home, while
"talking of all these things," the old man recollected
his neglected Bible, and asked, "Why, Mary, does
not our old book at home say somewhat about these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
things?" They went home, and examined the old book
with new light. "Why, Mary," asked the old man,
"is this indeed our old book? why, every thing in it
seems quite new." So true is it, that the teaching of
the Spirit gives new discernment as to the truths of
divine revelation.</p>

<p>A fact strikingly illustrating the children's love
to our evangelist may be here mentioned. In his
open-air preachings, especially in and about London,
he was usually attended by many of them, who sat
round him, in and about the pulpit, and handed to
him the notes of those who desired his counsels and
prayers. These children were exposed to the missiles
with which he was often assailed, but however terrified
they might be, or even hurt, they seldom shrunk;
"but," says he, "on the contrary, every time I was
struck, they turned up their little weeping eyes, and
seemed to wish they could receive the blows for me."</p>

<p>Speaking of his open-air labors, the devoted preacher
says, "Words cannot express the displays of divine
grace which we saw, and heard of, and felt. Lord, not
unto me, but unto thy name be all the glory." On a subsequent
occasion he writes, "We have had a glorious
season, a true Easter. Jesus Christ is risen indeed.
I have been preaching in Moorfields, and our Saviour
carries all before us. Nothing can resist his conquering
blood. It would have delighted you to see poor
sinners flock from the booths to see Jesus lifted up on
the pole of the gospel." The climax of his success
there, is one of the most remarkable letters that ever
came from a mortal's pen. He records at its close,
"We then retired to the Tabernacle, with my pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
full of notes from persons brought under concern, and
read them amidst the praises and spiritual acclamations
of thousands, who joined with the holy angels in
rejoicing that so many sinners were snatched, in such
an unexpected, unlikely place and manner, out of the
very jaws of the devil. This was the beginning of
the Tabernacle society. Three hundred and fifty
awakened souls were received in one day; and I believe
the number of notes exceeded a thousand. But
I must have done, believing you want to retire, to join
in mutual praise with me in thanksgiving to God and
the Lamb."</p>

<p>Having thus introduced the name of the Tabernacle,
it is important that the reader should be acquainted
with the origin of the buildings which have borne
that name. From the very first of what may be called
his irregular labors, Whitefield always declared that
he "would never be the founder of a sect." He kept
his word; yet two London churches remain as his
memorial&mdash;the Tabernacle, and Tottenham Court-road
chapel, the one in the north, and the other in the western
part of the metropolis. The Tabernacle, which
was first erected, was his more especial and favorite
field of labor, and he dwelt in the house adjoining it,
which is still the pastoral residence.</p>

<p>Moorfields, just without the limits of the old north
city wall of London, was, a few years before Whitefield
first knew it, a marsh, and during the greater
part of the year, was absolutely impassable. Having
been partially drained, a brick kiln was erected, and
the first bricks used in London are said to have been
manufactured there. Afterwards it was a field for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the practice of archery, when it was laid out in walks,
and called the City Mall. Though improved in name
and appearance, it became the rallying ground for the
rabble of London; wrestlers, boxers, and mountebanks,
the idle, the dissolute, and the profane, held
here their daily and nightly revels. It appeared, in
fact, to be one of the strong-holds of Satan, and therefore
became a most tempting and important point of
attack for the daring eloquence of Whitefield. All
London rang one day with the announcement that
Whitefield would preach the day following at Moorfields.</p>

<p>This was in January, 1739. Gillies says, "The
thing being strange and new, he found, on coming out
of the coach, an incredible number of people assembled.
Many told him that he would never come out
of that place alive. He went in, however, between
two friends, who by the pressure of the crowd were
soon parted from him entirely, and obliged to leave
him to the mercy of the rabble. But these, instead of
hurting him, formed a lane for him, and carried him
along to the middle of the fields, where a table had
been placed. This, however, having been broken by
the crowd, he mounted a wall, and preached to an
exceeding great multitude in tones so melting, that
his words drew tears and groans from the most abandoned
of his hearers. Moorfields became henceforth
one of the principal scenes of his triumphs. Thirty
thousand people sometimes gathered together to hear
him, and generous contributions here poured in for
his orphan-house at Bethesda. On one occasion
twenty pounds&mdash;about one hundred dollars&mdash;were received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in half-pennies, more than one person was able
to carry away, and enough to put one out of conceit
with a specie currency."</p>

<p>It was not till his fifth visit to London, in March,
1741, that Whitefield ventured to preach in Moorfields
on <em>a week-day</em>; the day selected for this bold
action being Good-Friday. His chief, if not his only
friends on this occasion, he tells us, were a few
"orthodox dissenters." These people perceiving the
inconvenience to which he was subjected by the
weather, during the morning and evening services in
Moorfields, procured the loan of a piece of ground,
and employed a carpenter to build a large temporary
shed, to screen the auditory from the cold and rain.
This building Whitefield called a "tabernacle," as it
was only intended to be used a few months during his
stay in his native country, previous to his return to
America. Providence, however, had otherwise determined,
and this proved the commencement of a permanent
establishment of the means of grace. A great
spiritual awakening took place; congregations became
very large, acquiring at the same time considerable
cohesion, and assuming a stationary character.
This original fabric of wood was a place of large
dimensions; and notwithstanding its rude aspect and
temporary design, it sufficed for the accommodation of
Whitefield and his flock, during the twelve succeeding
years&mdash;a period the most brilliant and useful of his
extraordinary career.</p>

<p>Some of Whitefield's friends, however, did not
approve of the original wooden structure; and anticipating
or desiring the formation of a Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
church, they called for the immediate erection of a
substantial brick building, a point which was debated
with a warmth approaching to violence, of which
Whitefield makes pathetic mention seven years afterwards.
Here then several important facts are established:
that the original tabernacle sprang not from
Whitefield, but from a voluntary movement among his
adherents, composed chiefly, if not wholly, of Protestant
dissenters; that the expense was borne not by
him, but by them; that much debate and dissension
attended the measure, proving the thoroughly free
and popular character of the original movement; and
that, as the edifice originated with the people alone,
so did the institution of regular worship. It is certain
that fears existed in the mind of Whitefield as to
the success of such an organization; but the results
most happily disappointed his expectations.</p>

<p>The subject of the erection of a more spacious
edifice in the place of the tabernacle of wood, was
first discussed at the mansion of Lady Huntingdon, in
Leicestershire, when Drs. Doddridge and Stonehouse,
and the Rev. Messrs. Hervey and Whitefield happened
to meet together, in the summer of 1751. During
the following winter, Whitefield began to make collections
for the object, and on almost its first presentation
in London, nine hundred pounds, or four thousand
five hundred dollars, were subscribed. "But,"
he says, "on the principle that burned children dread
the fire, I do not mean to begin until I get one thousand
in hand, and then to contract at a certain sum
for the whole." The fact was, that Whitefield had
often been in great straits for the support of his orphan-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in Georgia, "for I forgot," he says, "that
Professor Francke built in Glaucha, in a populous
country, and that I was building at the very tail of
the world." In March, 1753, he wrote to Mr. Charles
Wesley, "On Tuesday morning the first brick of our
new Tabernacle was laid with awful solemnity. I
preached from Exodus 20:24, 'In all places where I
record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will
bless thee.' The wall is now about a yard high. The
building is to be eighty feet square. It is on the old
spot. We have bought the house, and if we finish
what we have begun, shall be rent free for forty-six
years." In June the dedicatory services took place,
when the Tabernacle, though capable, with its capacious
galleries, of holding <em>four thousand</em> people, was
crowded almost to suffocation. Often have we seen
this vast building crowded with worshippers, with
delight have we occupied its pulpit, and with devout
gratitude do we record, that never for a moment has
the frown of heaven rested upon it. Thousands will
ever bless God for its erection.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently has the question been discussed,
to what denomination of Christians does the Tabernacle
really belong? In answer to this question, we give
a legal document which may also show what is done
in reference to houses of worship in England, under
the laws for the maintenance of religious toleration.</p>

<p>"These are to certifie whom it may Concern, that
a Certificate bearing date the Eighteenth Day of June,
in the year of Our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred
and Sixty-four, under the Hands of Starkey

<p class="sig">
"THOMAS COLLINS, Deputy Registrar."
</p>

<p>While the new Tabernacle was in the course of
erection, Whitefield visited Norwich, where his ministry
was largely attended, and notwithstanding much
opposition, was followed with considerable success.
Writing to his friend Keen, he says, "How does God
delight to exceed even the hopes, and to disappoint the
fears of his weak, though honest-hearted people. In
spite of all opposition, he hath caused us to triumph
even in Norwich. Thousands attend twice every day,
and hear with the greatest eagerness. I hope it will
appear yet more and more that God hath much people
here." Compelled by alarming illness, the result
of his too much preaching, he suddenly returned to
London, from whence he thus wrote to one of the converts
at Norwich: "I shall little regard the weakness
and indisposition of my body, if I can but have the
pleasure of hearing, if not before, yet at the great
day, that good was done to one precious soul at Norwich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Blessed be God for the seed sown there. I
doubt not but it will be watered with the dew of his
heavenly blessing, and bring forth a divine increase."</p>

<p>Truly the gospel did triumph, not only in the erection
of the Tabernacle in that city, but in preparing
sinners to be pillars in the temple of God, and to win
others to his service.</p>

<p>Among other converts won at Norwich, was the
afterwards popular and useful minister of Christ, the
Rev. Robert Robinson, of Cambridge, England. When
a young man, about eighteen, he resided in that city,
and was engaged in the business of a barber. When
he was walking one morning with several companions
who had agreed that day to take their pleasure, the
first object which attracted their attention was an old
woman who pretended to tell fortunes. They immediately
employed her to tell theirs, and that they
might qualify her for the undertaking, first made her
thoroughly intoxicated. Robinson was informed,
among other things, that he would live to a very old
age, and see his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
growing up around him. Though he
had assisted in intoxicating the old woman, he had
credulity enough to be struck with those parts of the
prediction which related to himself. "And so," said
he when alone, "I am to see children, grandchildren,
and great-grandchildren. At that age I must be a
burden to the young people. What shall I do? There
is no way for an old man to render himself more
agreeable to youth, than by sitting and telling them
pleasant and profitable stories. I will then," thought
he, "during my youth, endeavor to store my mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with all kinds of knowledge. I will see and hear,
and note down every thing that is rare and wonderful,
that I may sit, when incapable of other employments,
and entertain my descendants. Thus shall my
company be rendered pleasant, and I shall be respected,
rather than neglected, in old age. Let me see,
what can I acquire first? Oh, here is the famous
Methodist preacher, Whitefield; he is to preach here,
they say, to-night; I will go and hear him."</p>

<p>From these strange motives, as he told the celebrated
Rev. Andrew Fuller, he went to hear Whitefield
preach. That evening his text was, "But when
he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers,
who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Matt. 3:7. "Mr. Whitefield," said Robinson, "described
the Sadducees' character; this did not touch
me; I thought myself as good a Christian as any man
in England. From this he went to that of the Pharisees.
He described their exterior decency, but observed,
that the poison of the viper rankled in their
hearts. This rather shook me. At length, in the
course of his sermon, he abruptly broke off; paused
for a few moments; then burst into a flood of tears,
lifted up his hands and eyes, and exclaimed, 'Oh, my
hearers, <em>the wrath's to come! the wrath's to come!</em>'
These words sunk into my heart like lead in the
water; I wept, and when the sermon was ended retired
alone. For days and weeks I could think of
little else. Those awful words would follow me wherever
I went: 'The wrath's to come! The wrath's to
come!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had Whitefield completed the Tabernacle
in London, before he was earnestly solicited to hold
public services at the west end of the city, and Long-Acre
chapel, then under the charge of a dissenter, was
offered for his use. An unruly rabble endeavored to
drive the preacher from his post; but a running fire
of brickbats, broken glass, bells, drums, and clappers,
neither annoyed nor frightened the intrepid evangelist;
nor did an interference on the part of the hierarchy,
which followed soon after, prohibiting his preaching
in an incorporated chapel. "I hope you will not
look on it as contumacy," said Whitefield to the bishop,
"if I persist in prosecuting my design until I am
more particularly apprized wherein I have erred. I
trust the irregularity I am charged with will appear
justifiable to every lover of English liberty, and what
is all to me, be approved at the awful and impartial
tribunal of the great Bishop and Shepherd of souls."
Writing to Lady Huntingdon, he says, "My greatest
distress is so to act as to avoid rashness on the one
hand and timidity on the other;" and this shows, what
indeed was proved in his whole life, an entire absence
of that malignant element of fanaticism which courts
opposition and revels in it.</p>

<p>"Determined," as Mrs. Knight says, in her beautiful
volume, "<cite>Lady Huntingdon and her Friends</cite>," "not
to be beaten from his ground, yet hoping to escape
some of its annoyances, Whitefield resolved to build
a chapel of his own. Hence arose Tottenham Court-road
chapel, which went by the name of 'Whitefield's
soul-trap.'" Admirably does he say, "I pray the
Friend of sinners to make it a soul-trap indeed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
many wandering creatures. My constant work is
preaching fifteen times a week. Conviction and conversion
go on here, for God hath met us in our new
building." It was completed and dedicated in November,
1756. Though not equal in its triumphs to
the Tabernacle, the congregation has always been
large, and its preachers&mdash;always the same as those
at the Tabernacle&mdash;have not labored in vain. In
1829, '30, improvements were made in the building,
which still, however, contains Whitefield's pulpit. A
vast area in the centre was originally filled with plain
seats, where the masses of the people were accommodated
free of all pew rent.</p>

<p>Let not infidels tell us, that the religion of these
men and of those times was mere enthusiasm, and that
the temporal interests of men were neglected in professions
of high regard for those of a spiritual character.
Let such men know that within two years of the
opening of Tottenham Court-road chapel, not only
did the congregation build a parsonage-house for their
minister, but twelve almshouses for as many poor widows.
The Tabernacle has always acted with equal
generosity. In proportion to their means, few congregations
in the world have exceeded these two in
works of benevolence.</p>

<p>Assuredly what has sometimes been charged on
evangelical ministers&mdash;that they attend to the spiritual
interests of mankind, but neglect their temporal
sufferings&mdash;would never apply to Mr. Whitefield. No
sooner had he completed these large edifices, where
vast congregations assembled, than he was heard frequently
to plead for those laboring under oppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or distress in foreign lands. He preached in both
these houses in behalf of the poor French Protestants
in Prussia, who had suffered much from the cruelty
of the Russians, when great numbers of the nobility,
and some of the highest officers of the crown went to
hear him. The collections for this object amounted
to upwards of fifteen hundred pounds, or seven thousand
five hundred dollars; and for this disinterested
act of benevolence Whitefield received the thanks of
his Prussian Majesty.</p>

<p>Again, on the day recommended by the government
for a general fast, Mr. Whitefield preached both
at the Tabernacle and at Tottenham Court-road chapel,
after which he collected five hundred and sixty
pounds for the relief of the German Protestants, and
the sufferers by fire at Boston, for which he received
the unanimous thanks of the inhabitants of that town.
Lady Huntingdon wrote to one of her friends, "It
would delight you to have seen what crowds of the
mighty and noble flocked to hear him. The collection
was for the relief of the poor German Protestants. I
invited several to come who probably would not attend
his ministry on other occasions." Few places at
that time could boast of such a constellation of transcendent
genius and senatorial talent, such a brilliant
assemblage of wisdom, magnanimity, and oratorical
powers, as were then found within these houses of the
living God.</p>

<p>One word may be allowed here on the plain architecture
of these buildings. "We are," says the excellent
Mr. James, "in many things improved, and I
rejoice in the improvement; but the occasion of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
joy is at the same time the occasion of my fear and
my jealousy also. Our ecclesiastical architecture is
just now a special object of our attention. Whitefield,
it may be confessed, paid too little attention to
this; we, perhaps, are paying too much. His only
solicitude was to save souls, careless altogether of the
tastefulness of the building within which that work,
which has no relation to styles of architecture, was
carried on. His only calculation in the construction
of a building was, how many immortal souls could be
crowded within four square walls, and under a roof,
to hear 'the joyful sound.' Hence the somewhat uncouth
buildings which he erected. Ah, but when I
consider that every stone in those unsightly walls has
echoed to the sound of salvation and the hymns of
redeemed spirits, and that almost every spot on the
floor has been moistened by the tears of penitence,
then, in a feeling of sanctity I seem to lose the sense
of deformity, and there comes over me an awe and
solemnity which no modern gothic structure with its
lofty arches and painted windows can inspire. But
still, as religion is not only the most holy, but the
most beautiful thing in God's universe, there is no
reason why taste and devotion should not be united.
It is the ministry of the word, however, upon which
the church must be chiefly intent."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>WHITEFIELD'S SECOND VISIT TO AMERICA.<br />

1739, 1740.</h3>


<p>As in the preceding chapter, for the sake of connecting
the history of Whitefield's church edifices in
London, we have anticipated the order of events, we
go back to the period shortly before his second voyage
to America.</p>

<p>About the time of which we are now writing, a
circumstance occurred of deep interest, which Whitefield
relates at considerable length. Joseph Periam,
a young man in London, who had read his sermon on
"regeneration," became deeply impressed by it; he
sold all that he possessed, and prayed so loud and
fasted so long, that his family supposed him deranged,
and sent him to the Bedlam madhouse, where he was
treated as "methodistically mad," and as "one of
Whitefield's gang." The keepers threw him down,
and forced a key into his mouth, while they drenched
him with medicine. He was then placed in a cold
room without windows, and with a damp cellar under
it. Periam, however, found some means of conveying
a letter to Whitefield, requesting both advice and a
visit. These were promptly given. The preacher
soon discovered that Periam was not mad; and taking
a Mr. Seward and some other friends with him,
he went before the committee of the hospital to explain
the case. It must have been somewhat of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ludicrous scene. Seward so astounded the committee
by quoting Scripture, that they pronounced him to be
as mad as Periam. The doctors frankly told the deputation,
that in their opinion, Whitefield and his followers
were "really beside themselves." It was however
agreed, that if Whitefield would take Periam out
to Georgia, his release would be granted. Thus the
conference ended, and the young man went out as a
schoolmaster at the Orphan-house. There he was exemplary
and useful, and when he died two of his sons
were received into the institution.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield so successfully pleaded the cause
of his American orphans, that during his journeys of
twelve months he collected upwards of one thousand
pounds towards the erection of his intended house for
their accommodation. With this sum in his possession,
he set sail for America the second time, August
14, 1739, accompanied by his friend Mr. Seward, eight
men, one boy, and two children.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, the inhabitants of
Georgia were making every possible preparation for
his reception. The records of the trustees say, May
16, 1739, "Read a commission to the Rev. George
Whitefield to perform all religious and ecclesiastical
offices at Savannah, in Georgia." Again: "June 2,
1739. Sealed a grant of five hundred acres of land
to the Rev. George Whitefield, in trust for the use of
the house to be erected and maintained for the receiving
such children as now are, and shall hereafter be
left orphans in the colony of Georgia, in pursuance of
the direction of the Common Council held the 30th of
last month."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only was Whitefield anxious to establish the
orphan-house for the benefit of the whole colony of
Georgia, but having been ordained priest, for the purpose
of instructing the inhabitants of the town of Savannah,
he was desirous of making full proof of his
ministry among them. After a passage of nine weeks
he landed at Philadelphia, and was immediately invited
to preach in the churches; to which people of
all denominations thronged as in England. He was
especially pleased to find that they preferred sermons
when "not delivered within the church walls." And
it was well they did, for his fame had arrived in the
city before him, and crowds were collected to hear
him which no church could contain.</p>

<p>A letter written on this voyage to America has
recently come to light, which beautifully illustrates
the spirit by which Whitefield was now animated. It
was addressed to the Rev. John Cumming of Andover,
Hampshire, England.</p>

But bigotry and sectarian zeal have been the bane of
our holy religion. Though we have one Lord, one
faith, and one baptism, yet if we do not all worship
God in one particular way, we behave to each other
like Jews and Samaritans. Dear sir, I hope that neither

for his free grace in Christ. The partition wall has for
some time been broken down out of my heart, and I
can truly say, whosoever loves the Lord Jesus, 'the
same is my brother, and sister, and mother.' For this
reason, dear sir, I love you. For this reason, though
I decrease, yet I heartily wish you may increase, even
with all the increase of God. I am persuaded you
are like-minded. I believe my friends have prayed
for me. The Lord hath dealt most lovingly with me

not given me over into the hands of the enemy. A

</p></blockquote>

<p>The old court-house of Philadelphia, then standing
on Second and Market streets, had a balcony,
which several years before the visit of Whitefield had
been often used instead of a pulpit. In 1736, we find
that Mr. Abel Noble had preached "from the court-house
steps," on a Monday, to a large congregation
standing in Market-street, on the subject of keeping
the Sabbath. In the same year, Michael Welfare appeared
there to give his "warning voice," and now, in
1739, it became one of the favorite preaching stands
of the great evangelist. Here he stood, surrounded
by many thousands, even down to the side of the Delaware
river, not a few bathed in tears, and inquiring
after the way of salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Franklin says, "The multitudes of all sects
and denominations that attended his sermons were
enormous; and it was a matter of speculation with
me to observe the influence of his oratory on his hearers,
and how much they admired and respected him,
notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring
them that they were, naturally, half beasts and
half devils. It was wonderful to see the change soon
made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being
thoughtless and indifferent about religion, it seemed
as if all the world was growing religious; so that one
could not walk through the town in an evening without
hearing psalms sung in different families in every
street."</p>

<p>A constant attendant on his ministry at this time
says, "His hearers were never weary; every eye was
fixed on his expressive countenance; every ear was
charmed with his melodious voice; every heart captivated
with the beauty and propriety of his address.
He was no contracted bigot; all denominations partook
of his religious charity. Anxious in America
for our civil privileges, he was alike solicitous for the
spiritual and temporal happiness of mankind. No
man since the apostolic age preached oftener or with
better success. He was, moreover, a polite gentleman,
a faithful friend, an engaging companion, and a
sincere Christian. His sermons in the open air lasted
about one and a half hours."</p>

<p>Watson, in his "Annals of Philadelphia," speaking
of Whitefield's first visit to that city, tells us that he
preached to a crowd of fifteen thousand persons on
Society hill, and adds, "About the same time he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
far succeeded to repress the usual public amusements,
that the dancing-school was discontinued, and the
ball and concert rooms were shut up, as inconsistent
with the requisitions of the gospel. No less than
fourteen sermons were preached on Society hill in the
open air in one week, during the session of the Presbyterian
church; and the gazette of the day, in noticing
the fact, says, 'The change to religion here is
altogether surprising, through the influence of Whitefield;
no books sell but religious, and such is the
general conversation.'"</p>

<p>It is said, that though some gentlemen broke open
the assembly-rooms, no company could be induced to
visit them. Such was the popularity of Whitefield,
that when he left the city, about one hundred and
fifty gentlemen accompanied him as far as Chester,
fifteen miles from Philadelphia, where he preached to
about seven thousand people. At White Clay creek,
he preached to eight thousand people, three thousand
of whom, it is said, were on horseback. Many complimentary
effusions to him appeared in the newspapers,
and James Pemberton, a very distinguished
<em>Friend</em>, said of him, "In his conversation he is very
agreeable, and has not much of the priest; he frequents
no set company."</p>

<p>An old gentleman assured Watson, the annalist,
that on one occasion the words, "And he taught them,
saying," as pronounced by Whitefield on Society hill,
were heard at Gloucester point, a distance by water
of two miles.</p>

<p>Abundant reasons might be assigned for our introducing
in this place an account of the institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
called "the Log college." It has proved the parent
of every collegiate and theological institution connected
with the large and wealthy body of Presbyterians
in this country; it was originated by a family
which became especially endeared to Mr. Whitefield;
and from his journal, recording his visit to it, we
have, in some respects at least, the clearest statement
of facts concerning it which history has preserved.</p>

<p>As we have already shown, about one hundred and
forty years ago, the state of religion, both in Europe
and America, was very low. Nor was the condition of
the Presbyterian body an exception. As the late Dr.
Alexander, in his interesting volume, called "The Log
College," says, "The ministers composing the Presbyterian
church in this country were sound in the
faith, and strongly attached to the Westminster confession
of faith and catechisms, as were also their people;
and there were no diversities or contentions
among them respecting the doctrines of the gospel;
but as to the vital power of godliness, there is reason
to believe that it was little known or spoken of.
Revivals of religion were nowhere heard of, and an
orthodox creed, and a decent external conduct were
the only points on which inquiry was made, when persons
were admitted to the communion of the church.
Indeed, it was very much a matter of course, for all
who had been baptized in infancy, to be received into
communion at the proper age, without exhibiting or
possessing any satisfactory evidence of a change of
heart by the supernatural operations of the Holy
Spirit. And the habit of their preachers was to address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
their people as though they were all pious, and
only needed instruction and confirmation."</p>

<p>Such was the lamentable state of things when the
Rev. William Tennent, sen., an Irish clergyman past
the middle stage of life arrived in this country, about
the year 1716. After laboring for a season in the
state of New York, till about 1721, he received an
invitation to settle at Bensalem, where he ministered
to the small Presbyterian congregation till 1726, when
he was called to Neshaminy, in the same county, where
he labored for the rest of his life, living till 1746,
when he died, aged seventy-three. In Neshaminy the
good man felt that he was called not only to discharge
the duties of a preacher and pastor, but to look over
the whole country, and to devise means for the extension
of the cause of Christ. He had himself four
sons, the subjects of divine grace, and blessed with
talents for usefulness in the kingdom of the Redeemer,
and he felt that when other young men rose up in the
church, favored with ministerial talents, they also
would need mental cultivation. Hence his determination
to erect the humble building of which we now
write, which was the first Presbyterian literary and
theological institution in this country, the immediate
parent of the college at Princeton, and from which,
indeed, all similar institutions emanated.</p>

<p>The site of the Log college is about a mile from
Neshaminy creek, where the Presbyterian church has
long stood. The ground near and around it lies handsomely
to the eye, and the more distant prospect is
very beautiful; for while there is a considerable extent
of fertile, well-cultivated land, nearly level, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
view is bounded to the north and west by a range of
hills, which have a very pleasing appearance. Mr.
Whitefield has left in his "Journal," the only description
we have of the building. "The place," says he,
"wherein the young men study now, is in contempt
called 'the college.' It is a log-house about twenty
feet long, and nearly as many broad; and to me it
seemed to resemble the school of the old prophets,
for their habitations were mean. That they sought
not great things for themselves is plain from these
passages of Scripture, wherein we are told that each
of them took a beam to build them a house; and
that at the feast of the sons of the prophets, one of
them put on the pot, while the others went to fetch
some herbs out of the field. All that we can say of
most of our universities is, they are glorious without.
From this despised place, seven or eight worthy ministers
of Jesus have lately been sent forth; more are
almost ready to be sent, and the foundation is now
laying for the instruction of many others."</p>

<p>Of the senior Tennent, the founder of the Log college,
little more is known than what we have already
given. He was a member of the synod of Philadelphia,
who were satisfied with his reasons for leaving
the Established church of Ireland, and for several
years this body cordially co&#246;perated with him in his
zealous labors. Their unity of feeling, however, seems
to have declined. This we learn from a passage in
Whitefield's "Journal," which also gives us a beautiful
view of the good old man. "At my return home,
was much comforted by the coming of one Mr. Tennent,
an old gray-headed disciple and soldier of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Christ. He keeps an academy about twenty miles
from Philadelphia, and has been blest with four gracious
sons, three of which have been, and still continue
to be eminently useful in the church of Christ.
He brought three pious souls along with him, and
rejoiced me by letting me know how they had been
evil spoken of for their Master's sake. He is a great
friend of Mr. Erskine, of Scotland; and as far as I
can learn, both he and his sons are secretly despised
by the generality of the synod, as Mr. Erskine and
his friends are hated by the judicatories of Edinburgh,
and as the Methodist preachers, as they are called,
are by their brethren in England."</p>

<p>Not long after this, the Log college was visited by
Whitefield, who wrote the account we have already
given. He also says, under the date of Nov. 29, 1739,
"Set out for Neshaminy, twenty miles distant from
Trent Town, where old Mr. Tennent lives, and keeps
an academy, and where I was to preach to-day, according
to appointment. About twelve o'clock, we came
thither, and found about three thousand people gathered
together in the meeting-house yard. Mr. William
Tennent, junior, an eminent servant of Jesus
Christ, because we stayed beyond the time appointed,
was preaching to them. When I came up, he soon
stopped; sung a psalm, and then I began to speak as the
Lord gave me utterance. At first, the people seemed
unaffected, but in the midst of my discourse, the power
of the Lord Jesus came upon me, and I felt such a
struggling within myself for the people as I scarce
ever felt before. The hearers began to be melted
down immediately, and to cry much; and we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
good reason to hope the Lord intended good for many.
After I had finished, Mr. Gilbert Tennent gave a word
of exhortation, to confirm what had been delivered.
At the end of his discourse, we sung a psalm, and dismissed
the people with a blessing; O that the people
may say Amen to it. After our exercises were over,
we went to old Mr. Tennent's, who entertained us
like one of the ancient patriarchs. His wife, to me
seemed like Elizabeth, and he like Zachary; both, as
far as I can learn, walk in the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless. Though God was
pleased to humble my soul, so that I was obliged
to retire for a while, yet we had sweet communion
with each other, and spent the evening in concerting
what measures had best be taken for promoting
our dear Lord's kingdom. It happened very providentially
that Mr. Tennent and his brethren are appointed
to be a presbytery by the synod, so that
they intend bringing up gracious youths, and sending
them out from time to time into the Lord's vineyard."</p>

<p>We may be permitted to add here, that among the
ministers sent out by Mr. Tennent, from the Log college,
to preach the gospel, were his four sons, Gilbert,
William, John, and Charles, the Rev. Messrs. Samuel
Blair, John Blair, Charles Beatty, and Rev. Dr. Samuel
J. Finley, President of Princeton College; of some of
these excellent men the reader will hear again in the
course of this volume.</p>

<p>In reference to his first visit to Philadelphia,
Whitefield thus writes: "I have scarcely preached
among them, but I have seen a stirring among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
dry bones. Go where I will, I find people with great
gladness receive me into their houses. Sometimes I
think I am speaking to stocks and stones; but before
I have done, the power of the Lord comes over them,
and I find I have been ploughing up some fallow
ground, in a place where there has been a great famine
of the word of God. But as God's word increases,
so will the rage and opposition of the devil. Scoffers
seem to be at a stand what to say. They mutter in
coffee-houses, give a curse, drink a barrel of punch,
and then cry out against me for not preaching more
morality. Poor men, if God judges them, as he certainly
will do, by <em>their</em> morality, out of their own
mouths will he condemn them. Their morality, falsely
so called, will prove their damnation. God has enlarged
my heart to pray. Tears trickle down my
face, and I am in great agony; but the Lord is pleased
to set his seal to what he enables me to deliver.
Amid cries and groans in the congregation, God gives
me much freedom of speech. Many people and many
ministers weep. My own soul is much carried out.
I preached to a vast assembly of sinners; nearly
twelve thousand were collected; and I had not spoken
long, before I perceived numbers melting; as I proceeded,
the power increased, and thousands cried out;
never before did I see so glorious a sight. Oh, what
strong crying and tears were poured forth after the
dear Lord Jesus! Some fainted; and when they had
gotten a little strength, they would hear and faint
again. Never was my soul filled with greater power.
Oh, what thoughts and words did God put into my
heart. As great, if not greater commotion was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the hearts of the people. Look where I would, most
were drowned in tears."</p>

<p>An aged man who was living in 1806, and who
well remembered the scenes he witnessed, bore testimony
that after this visit of the great evangelist, public
worship was regularly celebrated in Philadelphia
twice a day for a whole year; and that on the Lord's
day it was celebrated three, and frequently four times
in each church. He said there were not less than
twenty-six societies regularly held for prayer and
Christian conference.</p>

<p>Such was the influence of Whitefield, not only in
Philadelphia, but throughout the colony of Pennsylvania,
that in the city attention to commerce was
suspended, and in the country the cultivation of the
land for the time being was abandoned, that people
might hear him proclaim the gospel of the Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p>Among other very striking conversions in Philadelphia
at this period, was that of a young lady, who
had for several years made a public profession of
Christianity, but who now became fully convinced
that "she was totally unacquainted with vital piety."
When Mr. Whitefield began his labors in that city,
she was greatly affected by his preaching, on which
she constantly attended, and often afterwards told
her friends, that after the first sermon she heard
him preach, she was ready to say with the woman of
Samaria, "Come see a man who told me all things
that ever I did." The preacher, she said, so exactly
described all the secret workings of her heart, her
wishes, and her actions, that she really believed he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was either more than human, or else that he was supernaturally
assisted to know her heart. She was
not then aware that all depraved hearts are much
alike, and that he who in lively colors can paint one,
gives a description which will be recognized by many
as their own. This young lady once walked twenty
miles to hear a sermon from Whitefield; she became
a most eminent Christian, and was one of the constituent
members of the church organized by Mr. Tennent.
She married Mr. Hugh Hodge, who was also
one of the seals of Mr. Whitefield's ministry, and a
deacon of the church, and for more than sixty years
she eminently "adorned the gospel of God in all
things."</p>

<p>During this first visit of Mr. Whitefield to Philadelphia,
another interesting circumstance occurred.
Whitefield preached one evening standing on the
steps of the court-house, in Market-street, which became,
as we have said, his favorite spot during that
and subsequent visits. A youth some thirteen years
of age stood near him, and held a lantern for his accommodation;
but becoming deeply absorbed in the
sermon, and strongly agitated, the lantern fell from
his hands, and was dashed in pieces. Those near the
boy, observing the cause of the accident, felt specially
interested, and for a few moments the meeting was
discomposed by the occurrence. Some fourteen years
afterwards, Mr. Whitefield, on his fifth visit to this
country, was visiting St. George's, in Delaware. He
was one day riding out with the Rev. Dr. John Rodgers,
then settled as the minister at St. George's, in
the closed carriage in which Whitefield generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
rode. Mr. Rodgers asked him whether he recollected
the occurrence of the little boy who was so affected
with his preaching as to let his lantern fall. Mr.
Whitefield replied, "O yes, I remember it well; and
have often thought I would give almost any thing in
my power, to know who that little boy was, and what
had become of him." Mr. Rodgers replied with a
smile, "I am that little boy." Mr. Whitefield, with
tears of joy, started from his seat, took him in his
arms, and with strong emotion remarked, that he was
the <em>fourteenth</em> person then in the ministry whom he
had discovered in the course of that visit to America,
in whose conversion he had, under God, been instrumental.</p>

<p>From Philadelphia, Whitefield was invited by Mr.
Noble to New York; this gentleman being the only
person with whom he then had an acquaintance in
that city. Upon his arrival, he waited with his
friend on the commissary, but he refused to Whitefield
the use of the church. This commissary of the
bishop, he says, "was full of anger and resentment,
and denied me the use of his pulpit before I asked for
it. He said they did not want my assistance. I replied,
that if they preached the gospel, I wished them
good luck: I will preach in the fields; for all places
are alike to me." The undaunted evangelist therefore
preached in the fields; and on the evening of the
same day, to a very thronged and attentive audience,
in the Rev. Mr. Pemberton's meeting-house, in Wall-street;
and continued to do so twice or three times
a day, with apparent success.</p>

<p>Of this visit to New York, and of Whitefield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
labors there, we have a graphic account, furnished by
one of his hearers, for "Prince's Christian History."
Of the first sermon in the fields, the writer says, "I
fear curiosity was the motive that led me and many
others into that assembly. I had read two or three
of Mr. Whitefield's sermons and part of his Journal,
and from them had obtained a settled opinion, that he
was a good man. Thus far was I prejudiced in his
favor. But then having heard of so much opposition,
and many clamors against him, I thought it possible
he might have carried matters too far; that some enthusiasm
might have mixed itself with his piety, and
that his zeal might have exceeded his knowledge.
With these prepossessions I went into the fields.
When I came there, I saw a great number of people,
consisting of Christians of all denominations, some
Jews, and a few, I believe, of no religion at all.
When Mr. Whitefield came to the place designated,
which was a little eminence on the side of a hill, he
stood still and beckoned with his hand, and disposed
the multitude upon the descent, before, and on each
side of him. He then prayed most excellently, in the
same manner, I suppose, that the first ministers of the
Christian church prayed. The assembly soon appeared
to be divided into two companies, the one of which
I considered as God's church, and the other the devil's
chapel. The first were collected round the minister,
and were very serious and attentive; the last had
placed themselves in the skirts of the assembly, and
spent most of their time in giggling, scoffing, talking,
and laughing. I believe the minister saw them, for
in his sermon, remarking on the cowardice and shamefacedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in Christ's cause, he pointed towards <em>this</em>
assembly, and reproached the former, those who
seemed to be Christians, with the boldness and zeal
with which the devil's vassals serve him. Towards
the last prayer the whole assembly appeared more
united, and all became hushed and still; a solemn
awe and reverence appeared in the faces of most, a
mighty energy attending the word. I heard and felt
something astonishing and surprising, but I confess I
was not at that time fully rid of my scruples. But as
I thought I saw a visible presence of God with Mr.
Whitefield, I kept my doubts to myself.</p>

<p>"Under this frame of mind, I went to hear him in
the evening at the Presbyterian church, where he expounded
to above two thousand people within and
without doors. I never in my life saw so attentive
an audience. All he said was demonstration, life, and
power. The people's eyes and ears hung on his lips.
They greedily devoured every word. I came home
astonished. Every scruple vanished; I never saw
nor heard the like; and I said within myself, 'Surely
God is with this man, of a truth.' He preached and
expounded in this manner twice every day for four
days, and his evening assemblies were continually
increasing.</p>

<p>"On Sunday morning at eight o'clock, his congregation
consisted of about fifteen hundred people; but
at night several thousands came together to hear him;
and the place being too strait for them, many were
forced to go away, and some, it is said, with tears
lamented their disappointment. After sermon he left
New York at ten at night, to fulfil a promise that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
had made to preach at Elizabethtown, at eleven <small>A. M.</small>
the next day."</p>

<p>We give a few paragraphs from the same vigorous
pen, relating to the personal manners and the doctrines
of our evangelist. "He is a man of a middle
stature, of a slender body, of a fair complexion, and
of a comely appearance. He is of a sprightly, cheerful
temper, and acts and moves with great agility and
life. The endowments of his mind are very uncommon;
his wit is quick and piercing; his imagination
lively and florid; and as far as I can discern, both
are under the direction of an exact and solid judgment.
He has a most ready memory, and I think
speaks entirely without notes. He has a clear and
musical voice, and a wonderful command of it. He
uses much gesture, but with great propriety. Every
accent of his voice, every motion of his body <em>speaks</em>,
and both are natural and unaffected. If his delivery
is the product of art, it is certainly the perfection of
it, for it is entirely concealed. He has a great mastery
of words, but studies much plainness of speech.</p>

<p>"His doctrine is right <em>sterling</em>. I mean, perfectly
agreeable to the Articles of the church of England, to
which he frequently appeals for the truth of it. He
loudly proclaims all men by nature to be under sin, and
obnoxious to the wrath and curse of God. He maintains
the absolute necessity of supernatural grace to bring
men out of this state. He asserts the righteousness
of Christ to be the only cause of the justification of
the sinner; that this is received by faith; that this
faith is the gift of God; that where faith is wrought,
it brings the sinner under the deepest sense of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
guilt and unworthiness to the footstool of sovereign
grace, to accept of mercy as the free gift of God, only
for Christ's sake. He denies that good works have
any share in our justification: that indeed they do
justify our faith, and necessarily flow from it, as
streams from the fountain; but Christ's external
righteousness imputed to us, and his inherent righteousness
wrought in us, is the only cause of man's salvation.
He asserts the absolute necessity of the new
birth, where a principle of new life is ingenerated in
the heart of man, and an entire change is produced in
the temper and disposition of the soul; and that this
new production is the work only of God's blessed
Spirit. That wherever this change is wrought, it is
permanent and abiding, and that the gates of hell
shall never prevail against it. He asserts that the
special influence and indwelling of the Spirit, was not
peculiar to the first Christians, but that it is the common
privilege of believers in all ages of the church;
that the Holy Spirit is the author of the sanctification
and comfort of all God's people; and that, even in
these days, if any man have not the spirit of Christ,
he is none of his. He said, that to many of his hearers,
he feared he spoke in an unknown tongue; that
he preached great mysteries; that true Christians
knew what he meant, and that all his hearers, if they
are saved, must be brought to understand them. These
are some of the doctrines which have been attended
with such mighty power in this city. This is the doctrine
of the martyrs. This they sealed with their
blood; notwithstanding that so many in our days
have departed from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield speaks much of the language of
the New Testament; and has an admirable faculty in
explaining the Scriptures. He strikes out of them
such lights, and unveils those excellencies which surprise
his hearers, when he expounds them. He expresses
the highest love and concern for the souls of
men; and speaks of Christ with the most affectionate
appropriation&mdash;'<em>My Master! My Lord!</em>' He is no
enemy to the innocent freedoms and liberties of the
gospel; nor does he affect singularity in indifferent
things. He spends not his zeal in trifles, but says,
'The kingdom of God consists not in meats and
drinks; but in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost.' He breathes a most catholic spirit, and
prays most earnestly that God would destroy all that
bigotry and party zeal which has divided Christians.
He supposes some of Christ's flock are to be found
under every denomination, and upbraids the uncharitableness
of those who confine the church to their own
communion. He professes a most sincere love to all
those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,
and declares that he has no design to make a party
in religion. He professes that his whole design in
preaching the gospel is to bring men to Christ, to
deliver them from their false confidences, to raise
them from their dead formalities, and to revive primitive
Christianity among them; and if he can obtain
this end, he will leave them to their liberty, and they
may go to what church, and worship God in what
form they like best."</p>

<p>While going from Philadelphia to New York, or
on his return, Whitefield appears to have preached at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Maidenhead, Abington, Neshaminy, Freehold, Burlington,
Elizabethtown, and New Brunswick, to many
thousands, gathered from various parts, among whom
there had been a considerable awakening under the
ministry of Mr. Frelinghuysen, a Reformed Dutch
minister, and the Rev. Messrs. Tennent, Blair, and
Rowland. It was no less pleasing to him than
strange to see such congregations in a foreign land;
ministers and people shedding tears, sinners struck
with awe, and religious persons who had been much
persecuted, filled with joy. The old <em>Tennent church</em>
at Freehold, where preached Whitefield, Brainerd,
Davies, and other "famous men" of that day, still
echoes with the same gospel. In size the building is
forty feet by sixty, with three entrances on the larger
side. The pulpit is on the north side of the house,
immediately opposite the central door, so that the
minister faces the width of the church instead of its
length. The pulpit is very narrow, and is surmounted
with a sounding-board, according to the custom of our
fathers. In the middle aisle lie buried the remains of
the sainted William Tennent, whose death took place
about seven years after that of Whitefield, at the age
of seventy-two years. A handsome monumental tablet
records the leading dates of his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may inquire as to the localities
honored by Whitefield's preaching in and about
the city of New York. We find many records of his
discoursing in the open fields of the surrounding country;
the old City Exchange, which stood at the foot of
Broad-street, near Water-street, and which was built
on large arches, was a favorite spot for itinerant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
preachers, and for Whitefield among the rest. During
his various visits to New York, from 1745 to
1760, he generally preached in the Presbyterian church
in Wall-street, which was then the only church of that
denomination in the city, and of which the Rev. Dr.
Pemberton, from Boston, was the minister. Afterwards,
a few years before his death, he was accustomed
to preach in the Brick church in Beekman-street;
which was then familiarly called the "Brick
meeting," and in common parlance, said to be "in the
fields;" so little was the city extended at that period.
So prosperous was his ministry in New York, that it
was found necessary immediately to enlarge the Presbyterian
church in Wall-street, by the erection of
galleries; and a year or two afterwards it was again
enlarged about one-third, in order to accommodate
the stated worshippers.</p>

<p>When Whitefield was preaching before a very
large number of the seamen of New York, he introduced
the following bold apostrophe into his sermon:
"Well, my boys, we have a cloudless sky, and are
making fine headway over a smooth sea, before a light
breeze, and we shall soon lose sight of land. But
what means this sudden lowering of the heavens, and
that dark cloud arising from beneath the western
horizon? Hark! don't you hear the distant thunder?
Don't you see those flashes of lightning? There is a
storm gathering. Every man to his duty. How the
waves rush and dash against the ship! The air is
dark. The tempest rages. Our masts are gone!
What next?" The unsuspecting tars, reminded of
former perils on the deep, as if struck by the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of magic, arose, and with united voices exclaimed,
"Take to the longboat, sir!" The reader may well
imagine how this very natural answer would be used
by the preacher.</p>

<p>While at New York, Whitefield wrote, "God willing,
in about seven months I hope to see New England
on my return to Europe. An effectual door is
there opened, and no wonder there are many adversaries.
Shortly I expect to suffer for my dear Master."
And after his return to Philadelphia, he showed
his piety and meekness by writing to the Rev. Dr.
Pemberton, of New York, "I have been much concerned
since I saw you, lest I behaved not with that
humility towards you which is due from a babe to a
father in Christ; but you know, reverend sir, how
difficult it is to meet with success, and not be puffed
up with it; and therefore, if any such thing was discernible
in my conduct, O pity me, and pray to the
Lord to heal my pride. All I can say is, that I desire
to learn of Jesus Christ to be meek and lowly in
heart; but my corruptions are so strong, and my employ
so dangerous, that I am sometimes afraid."</p>

<p>One of the most important incidents of this journey
to New York, was the meeting of Whitefield with Gilbert
Tennent. Two powerful preachers could hardly
resemble each other less; and the great strength of
each lay in characteristics in which the other was deficient.
In one point, especially, Whitefield felt and
recorded his new friend's superiority. He heard Tennent
preach. "Never before heard I such a searching
sermon. He went to the bottom indeed, and did not
'daub with untempered mortar.' He convinced me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
more and more, that we can preach the gospel of
Christ no further than we have experienced the power
of it in our hearts. I found what a babe and novice
I was in the things of God." These men, as Tracy
says, having once met, could not but be friends and
allies for life; and the effects of their alliance could
not fail to be felt by thousands.</p>

<p>Both at Philadelphia and New York, printers applied
to Whitefield for copies of his sermons for publication,
and two were so issued, in the influence of
which their author had cause to rejoice. In an after-period,
the celebrated Benjamin Franklin printed
Whitefield's "Journal in New England," still extant;
a copy of which was sold at auction in Philadelphia
in 1855, for about thirty times its original price. His
journals, indeed, and his sermons became considerable
articles in commerce, and did not a little, amid the
comparatively sparse population of the country, to
extend both his fame and his usefulness.</p>

<p>But the time was now come when it became important
that Whitefield should pursue his course towards
Savannah. He could not, however, regret his
stay so long on the road. "It is unknown," he says,
"what deep impressions have been made on the hearts
of hundreds. Many poor sinners have, I trust, been
called home, and great numbers are under strong convictions.
An opposer told me I had unhinged many
<em>good sort of people</em>. I believe it."</p>

<p>Nor was this the only good he had done. No
small sympathy had been excited among Christian
people in favor of his orphan family, and a spirit of
liberality and of prayer was extensively cherished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"They sent me," says the grateful evangelist, "butter,
sugar, chocolate, pickles, cheese, and flour, for my orphans;
and indeed, I could almost say, they would
pluck out their own eyes and give me. O that what
God says of the church of Philadelphia may now be
fulfilled in the city called after her name&mdash;'I know
thy works.'"</p>

<p>The ready liberality which everywhere met Whitefield,
determined him to pursue his journey by land.
He therefore procured a vessel, in which he sent on
his family and their supplies to Savannah. Of this
sloop, Captain Gladman was master; and a young man
who had recently been converted by the preaching of
the great evangelist, willingly offered himself as mate.
We have already seen that he was accompanied southward
as far as Chester by a very large company of
gentlemen of Philadelphia; and on his arrival at that
place, a court was about to open, but the judges sent
him word that they would not commence their business
until the sermon, which they expected from him,
was over. Nearly a thousand people had travelled
from Philadelphia to hear it, and it was thought that
those collected from places many miles around, composed
an assembly of not less than seven thousand
persons. A platform was erected, and it was believed
that many of his hearers obtained something infinitely
better than the mere gratification of their curiosity.</p>

<p>Among other places at which he preached on this
journey, was White Clay creek, endeared to him not
only as the place where he first met with his beloved
friend William Tennent, but as the residence of a
Welsh family who had heard him preach at Cardiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and Kingswood before they emigrated, and who bore,
what was to him a fact of endearing interest, the
name of <em>Howell</em>. But during this tour Whitefield had
to endure considerable privations and peril in riding
through the woods. On one occasion, he heard the
wolves "howling like a kennel of hounds" near to the
road; on another, he had a narrow escape in trying
to cross the Potomac in a storm. Here also he had
once to swim his horse, owing to the floods; for it
was now the depth of winter. One night, Seward
and he lost their way in the woods of South Carolina,
and were much alarmed at seeing groups of negroes
dancing around large fires. Notwithstanding all the
hardships, however, of the journey, no real injury was
sustained from it.</p>

<p>Our evangelist at length arrived at Charleston in
good health and spirits. But he could not obtain
admittance to St. Philip's church; Garden, the commissary,
who had once promised to "defend him with
life and fortune," was absent, and the curate would
not open the doors without his leave. The people,
however, had not forgotten him, and the Rev. Josiah
Smith, the congregational minister, and the pastor of
the French church, at once threw open their houses
and pulpits, and rich indeed were the blessings they
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The congregations during his present visit to
Charleston were large and polite; but he says they
presented "an affected finery and gayety of dress and
deportment, which I question if the court-end of London
could exceed." Before he left, however, there
was what he called "a glorious alteration in the audience."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Many of them wept; and the hitherto light
and airy had visibly strong feelings, as shown in their
countenances. Such was their extreme anxiety to hear
more from him, that after he had gone to the shore to
sail for Georgia, they prevailed on him to preach
again.</p>

<p>On the next morning, Whitefield and his companions
left Charleston in a canoe for Savannah; and on
their way lay on the ground in the woods, surrounded
by large fires to keep off the wild beasts. On this fact
he makes the reflection, "An emblem, I thought, of the
divine love and presence keeping off evils and corruptions
from the soul." On his arrival at Savannah, January
11, 1740, he was very happy to meet his family,
who had arrived there three weeks before him; and
to find, by letters from England, New York, etc., that
the work of the Lord prospered. One thing, however,
greatly distressed him. The colony of Georgia was
reduced even to a much lower state than when he left
it, and was deserted by nearly all who could get away.
He thought that to employ those who were left, would
render them an important service, and that the money
thus expended might be the means of keeping them in
the colony.</p>

<p>During the absence of Mr. Whitefield from Georgia,
Mr. Habersham had fixed on a plot of ground of
five hundred acres, about ten miles from Savannah, on
which the orphan-house should stand, and had already
commenced to clear and stock it. The orphans, in
the mean time, were accommodated in a hired house.
Whitefield afterwards regretted the course pursued.
He found the condition of the orphans so pitiable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the inhabitants so poor, that he immediately opened
an infirmary, hired a large house at a great rent, and
took in, at different times, twenty-four orphans.</p>

<p>In the March following, Whitefield was again at
Charleston, where he went to meet his brother, the
captain of a ship, from England. Here he was requested
by many of the inhabitants to give some
account of his poor orphans, which he did in the house
of worship occupied by his friend the Rev. Josiah
Smith, the first native of South Carolina who received
a literary degree. Such was the spirit excited, that
the collection amounted to seventy pounds sterling.
This was no small encouragement, especially as he
had reason to believe that most of it came from those
who had received spiritual benefit from his ministry.</p>

<p>But if Whitefield now had his joys in Charleston,
so he had also his sorrows. We have seen that
in a previous visit to this city, he had considered
himself "set for the defence of the gospel." He had
remarked, in reference to the twelfth article of the
church of England, "Observe, my dear brethren, the
words of the article, 'Good works are the fruit of
faith, and follow after justification.' How can they
then precede, or be in any way the cause of it? No,
our persons must be justified, before our performances
can be accepted." Commissary Garden, of whom we
have already spoken, now seized the opportunity of
Whitefield's visit to Charleston, to write him a letter,
dated March 17, attacking his doctrine of justification,
and challenging him to defend what he had said
concerning the bishop of London and his clergy. In
this letter, he urged in reply to what the evangelist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
had said, "If good works do necessarily spring out of
a true and lively faith, and a true and lively faith
necessarily precedes justification, the consequence is
plain, that good works must not only follow after, but
precede justification also." Whitefield replied the
next day, "I perceive that you are angry overmuch.
Was I never so much inclined to dispute, I would
stay till the cool of the day. Your letter more and
more confirms me, that my charge against the clergy
is just and reasonable. It would be endless to enter
into such a private debate as you, reverend sir, seem
desirous of. You have read my sermon: be pleased
to read it again; and if there be any thing contrary
to sound doctrine, or the Articles of the church of
England, be pleased to let the public know it from
the press; and then let the world judge whether you
or my brethren the clergy have been rashly slandered."
This was but the commencement of a controversy, in
which were concerned Garden of Charleston, and the
Rev. Messrs. Croswell and Gee of Boston, portions of
which are preserved in the Old South church library,
in the latter city; and which was afterwards resumed
between Garden and Smith, of Charleston, in the
"South Carolina Gazette," as may be seen in the
library of the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Whitefield had returned to Savannah,
and on March 25, he laid the first brick of
the main building of the orphan-house, which he called
<em>Bethesda</em>, that is, a house of mercy. It was built of
wood, and measured seventy feet by forty. By this
time nearly forty children had been received, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
provided for with food and raiment; and counting
the workmen with these, he had nearly one hundred
persons to feed day by day. To do all this he had
very little money in the bank; still he was not discouraged,
being persuaded that his present duty was
to advance the interests of the colony by carrying on
his work. "As yet," says he, "I am kept from the
least doubting. The more my family increases, the
more enlargement and comfort I feel. Set thy almighty
<em>fiat</em> to it, O gracious Father, and for thine
own name's sake convince us more and more, that thou
wilt never forsake those who put their trust in thee."
On reviewing this passage fifteen years afterwards,
he wrote, "Hitherto, blessed be God, I have not been
disappointed of my hope."</p>

<p>We close our present chapter with a very short
visit to Charleston. In this city Whitefield had assuredly
produced a very extraordinary excitement,
and very opposite opinions were entertained in reference
to his character and doctrines. On the day
after he had laid the first stone of Bethesda, Mr. Smith
undertook at Charleston to defend the conduct and
character of his beloved friend, in a sermon from Job
32:17: "I said, I will answer also my part; I also
will show mine opinion." As this discourse was published
during the following June, with a commendatory
preface by the Rev. Drs. Colman and Cooper
of Boston, and is still highly valued as a piece of contemporary
history, we give an extract, particularly as
to the <em>manner</em> of the preaching of the great evangelist.</p>

<p>"He is certainly a finished preacher. A noble
negligence ran through his style. The passion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
flame of his expressions will, I trust, be long felt by
many. My pen cannot describe his action and gestures,
in all their strength and decencies. He appeared
to me, in all his discourses, to be very deeply affected
and impressed in his own heart. How did that
burn and boil within him, when he spake of the things
which he had 'made touching the King.' How was
his tongue like the pen of a ready writer, touched as
with a coal from the altar. With what a flow of
words, what a ready profusion of language, did he
speak to us upon the great concerns of our souls. In
what a flaming light did he set <em>our</em> eternity before us.
How earnestly he pressed Christ upon us. How did
he move our passions with the constraining love of
<em>such</em> a Redeemer. The awe, the silence, the attention
which sat upon the face of the great audience, was an
argument how he could reign over all their powers.
Many thought he spake as never man spake before
him. So charmed were the people with his manner
of address, that they shut up their shops, forgot their
secular business, and laid aside their schemes for the
world; and the oftener he preached, the keener edge
he seemed to put upon their desires to hear him again.</p>

<p>"How awfully, with what thunder and sound, did
he discharge the artillery of heaven upon us. And
yet, how could he soften and melt even a soldier of
Ulysses with the mercy of God. How close, strong,
and pungent were his applications to the conscience;
mingling light and heat; pointing the arrows of the
Almighty at the hearts of sinners, while he poured in
the balm upon the wounds of the contrite, and made
broken bones rejoice. Eternal themes, the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
solemnities of our religion, were all <em>alive</em> upon his
tongue. So, methinks&mdash;if you will forgive the figure&mdash;St.
Paul would <em>look</em> and speak in a pulpit. In some
such manner, I am tempted to conceive of a seraph,
were he sent down to preach among us, and to tell us
what things he had seen and heard above.</p>

<p>How bold and courageous did he look. He was
no flatterer; he would not suffer men to settle on their
lees; and did not prophesy smooth things, nor sew
pillows under their arms. He taught the way of God
in truth, and regarded not the persons of men. He
struck at the politest and most modish of our vices,
and at the most fashionable entertainments, regardless
of every one's presence, but His in whose name he
spoke with this authority. And I dare warrant, if
none should go to these diversions until they have
answered the solemn questions he put to their consciences,
our theatre would soon sink and perish. I
freely own he has taken my heart."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>CONTINUATION OF WHITEFIELD'S SECOND VISIT TO
AMERICA.<br />
1740.</h3>


<p>At the period when Whitefield laid the cornerstone
of his Bethesda, his health was much impaired,
and his spirits depressed. But it was necessary
that funds should be obtained, to meet the claims now
daily made upon him. He had received handsome
donations from Charleston, New York, and Philadelphia,
yet the urgent demand was for more. He
therefore embarked from Charleston for Newcastle,
Delaware, in a sloop, and arrived there in about ten
days. Passing on from thence to Philadelphia, he
found the churches closed against him. The commissary
told him that he would lend the church to him
no more. The laconic answer of Whitefield was,
"The fields are open;" and eight thousand people
assembled to hear him the same evening, and ten thousand
on the following day. On the following Lord's
day morning, he collected one hundred and ten pounds
sterling for his "poor orphans," and then went to the
Episcopal church, where the commissary preached a
sermon on justification by works. As Whitefield was
recognized at church, it was naturally expected that
in the evening he would answer the sermon; nor was
the public expectation disappointed. After his sermon,
he collected eighty pounds more for Bethesda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>But far higher success than this attended his labors.
Societies for worship were commenced in different
parts of the town; not a few began seriously to inquire
after the way of salvation; many negroes came
to the evangelist with the inquiry, "Have I a soul?"
and a church was formed, of which the distinguished
Gilbert Tennent was the eminently useful pastor. No
less than one hundred and forty, who had undergone
a previous strict examination as to their personal
piety, were received as constituent members of the
church, and large additions were from time to time
made to their number.</p>

<p>Several events of special interest occurred during
this visit to Philadelphia. Tennent had to tell a series
of delightful facts as to the usefulness of Whitefield's
former labors. He began to deliberate on a plan for
a negro school in Pennsylvania, as he did afterwards
also in Virginia, but unexpected difficulties intervened,
and both in the end were abandoned. Mr. Jones, the
Baptist minister of the city, told Whitefield of the
change produced by his former preaching on the minds
of two ministers; one of whom stated to his congregation
that he had hitherto been deceiving both himself
and them, and added, that he could not preach to
them at present, but requested them to unite in prayer
with him; and the other resigned his charge, to itinerate
among the unenlightened villages of New Jersey
and elsewhere. Another fact was, that an Indian
trader became so impressed with the preaching of
Whitefield, that he had given up his business, and
was gone to teach the Indians with whom he used to
trade. Nor had his usefulness stopped here: he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of a drinking club, which had attached to it a negro
boy remarkable for his powers of mimicry. This boy
was directed by the gentlemen who composed the
club to exercise his powers on Mr. Whitefield: he did
so, but very reluctantly; at length he stood up and
said, "I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not; unless
you repent, you will all be damned." This unexpected
speech had such an effect as to break up the club,
which met no more.</p>

<p>We add a few paragraphs from Seward's journal,
who soon after sailed for England to promote the
interests of Georgia, and who died in the parent country.
They date from the 24th to the 26th of April.
"Came to Christopher Wigner's plantation in Skippack,
where many Dutch people are settled, and
where the famous Mr. Spalemburg lately resided. It
was surprising to see such a multitude of people gathered
together in such a wilderness country, thirty
miles distant from Philadelphia. Mr. Whitefield was
exceedingly carried out, in his sermon, to press poor
sinners to come to Christ by faith, and claim all their
privileges; namely, not only righteousness and peace,
but joy in the Holy Ghost; and after he had done,
our dear friend Peter Bohler preached in Dutch, to
those who could not understand Mr. Whitefield in
English."</p>

<p>"Before Mr. Whitefield left Philadelphia, he was
desired to visit one who was under a deep sense of sin,
from hearing him preach. In praying with this person,
he was so carried beyond himself, that the whole
company, about twenty, seemed to be filled with the
Holy Ghost, and magnified the God of heaven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arose at three o'clock, and though Mr. Whitefield
was very weak in body, yet the Lord enabled
him to ride nearly fifty miles, and to preach to about
five thousand people at Amwell, with the same power
as usual. Mr. Gilbert Tennent, Mr. Rowland, Mr.
Wales, and Mr. Campbell, four godly ministers, met
us here."</p>

<p>"Came to New Brunswick. Met Mr. Noble from
New York, a zealous promoter of our Lord's kingdom.
He said their society at New York was enlarged
from seventy to one hundred and seventy, and
was daily increasing; and that Messrs. Gilbert and
William Tennent, Mr. Rowland, and several others,
were hard laborers in our Lord's vineyard."</p>

<p>It will be readily supposed that by this time
Whitefield and his movements had become so much a
matter of interest as to be frequently discussed in the
newspapers of the day.</p>

<p>The "New England Weekly Journal" of April 29,
1740, copies from a Philadelphia paper of April 17:
"The middle of last month the Rev. Mr. Whitefield
was at Charleston, and preached five times, and collected
at one time upwards of &#163;70 sterling for the
benefit of the orphan-house in Georgia; and on Sunday
last, after ten days' passage from Georgia, he
landed at Newcastle, where he preached morning and
evening. On Monday morning he preached to about
three thousand at Wilmington, and in the evening
arrived in this city. On Tuesday evening he preached
to about eight thousand on Society hill, and preached
at the same place yesterday morning and evening."
Then follows a list of his appointments daily to April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
29, during which time he was to preach at Whitemarsh,
Germantown, Philadelphia, Salem, N. J., Neshaminy,
Skippack, Frederick township, Amwell, New
Brunswick, Elizabethtown, and New York. On May
6th, the Journal copied a Philadelphia notice of April
24th, that he had preached on the previous Sabbath to
fifteen thousand hearers, and on Monday at Greenwich
and Gloucester, and that he would return to
Georgia before visiting New England.</p>

<p>The Journal of May 20th, contains a letter from
Whitefield to a friend in England, dated New Brunswick,
N. J., April 27. Of his visit to Charleston
he says, "A glorious work was begun in the hearts of
the inhabitants, and many were brought to cry out,
'What shall we do to be saved?' A fortnight ago,
after a short passage of ten days, I landed in Pennsylvania,
and have had the pleasure of seeing and
hearing that my poor endeavors for promoting Christ's
kingdom, when here last, were not altogether in vain
in the Lord. I cannot tell you how many have come
to me laboring under the deepest convictions, and
seemingly truly desirous of finding rest in Jesus Christ.
Several have actually received him into their hearts
by faith, and have not only righteousness and peace,
but joy in the Holy Ghost. In short, the word has
run and been much glorified, and many negroes also
are in a fair way of being brought home to God.
Young ones I intend to buy, and do not despair of
seeing a room full of that despised generation, in a
short time, singing and making melody with grace in
their hearts to the Lord.</p>

<p>"An effectual door is opened for preaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
everlasting gospel, and I daily receive fresh and most
importunate invitations to preach in all the counties
round about. God is pleased to give a great blessing
to my printed sermons. They are in the hands of
thousands in these parts, and are a means of enlightening
and building up many in their most holy faith.
The clergy, I find, are most offended at me. The
commissary of Philadelphia, having gotten a little
stronger than when I was here last, has thrown off
the mask, denied me the pulpit, and last Sunday
preached up an historical faith, and justification by
works. But the people only flock the more. The
power of God is more visible than ever in our assemblies,
and more and more are convinced that I preach
the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Some of the bigoted,
self-righteous Quakers now also begin to spit out a
little of the venom of the serpent. They cannot bear
the doctrine of original sin, and of an imputed righteousness
as the cause of our acceptance with God.
I have not yet met with much opposition from the
dissenters; but when I come to tell many of them,
ministers as well as people, that they hold the truth
in unrighteousness, that they talk and preach of justifying
faith, but never felt it in their hearts, as I am
persuaded numbers of them have not, then they no
doubt will shoot out their arrows, even bitter words."</p>

<p>While on his voyage from Charleston to Newcastle,
Whitefield seems to have devoted the 4th of April,
1740, to correspondence on the subject of marriage.
"I find," said he, "by experience, that a mistress is
absolutely necessary for the due management of my
increasing family, and to take off some of that care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
which at present lies upon me." His letters were addressed
to a young lady and her parents, connected
with a family much devoted to piety. Here, as everywhere
else, his heart is transparent. He says to the
parents of Miss E&mdash;&mdash;, "I write only because I believe
it is the will of God that I should alter my state; but
your denial will fully convince me that your daughter
is not the person appointed for me. He knows my
heart; I would not marry but for him, and in him, for
ten thousand worlds."</p>

<p>The next year, having returned to England, Whitefield,
like his eminent friend John Wesley, was married,
and, like him also, was unhappy in his domestic
relation. In each case, the husband exacted a previous
pledge that the wife should never prevent the
delivery of a single sermon; and this was followed
by separation from the wife for weeks, months, or
even years, in the prosecution of their arduous labors.
In the case of Whitefield, his marriage in Wales, with
a widow lady, in 1741, was followed by the birth of
a son; previous to which event he had said, in the
joy of his heart, that his name should be John, and
that he should be a preacher of the everlasting gospel.
The first prediction was realized, and when his
child was a week old, the good man told his people in
the Tabernacle, London, that he would live to preach,
and "be great in the sight of the Lord." But alas,
at the end of four months John died, and his father
very wisely wrote in his journal: "I hope what happened
before his birth, and since at his death, has
taught me such lessons as, if duly improved, may render
his mistaken parent more sober-minded, more experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in Satan's devices, and consequently more
useful in his future labors in the church of God."</p>

<p>On the death of his wife somewhat suddenly, August
9, 1768, Mr. Whitefield himself preached her
funeral sermon, from Romans 8:28: "And we know
that all things work together for good to them that
love God, to them that are the called according to his
purpose." In describing her character, he particularly
mentioned her fortitude and courage, and suddenly
exclaimed, "Do you remember my preaching in those
fields by the stump of the old tree? The multitude
was great, and many were disposed to be riotous. At
first I addressed them with firmness; but when a gang
of desperate banditti drew near, with the most ferocious
looks, and horrid imprecations and menaces,
my courage began to fail. My wife was then standing
behind me, as I stood on the table. I think I
hear her now. She pulled my gown"&mdash;himself suiting
the action to the word, by placing his hand behind
him and touching his robe&mdash;"and looking up, said,
'George, play the man for your God.' My confidence
returned. I again spoke to the multitude with boldness
and affection; they became still; and many were
deeply affected."</p>

<p>Before we leave Philadelphia, we may relate an
instance or two as to the power of his eloquence. Dr.
Franklin says, "He had a loud and clear voice, and
articulated his words so perfectly that he might be
heard and understood to a great distance; especially
as his auditors observed the most profound silence.
He preached one evening from the top of the court-house
steps, which are in the middle of Market-street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses
it at right angles. Both streets were filled with his
hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the
hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn
how far he might be heard by setting backwards down
the street towards the river; and I found his voice
distinct till I came near Front-street, where some
noise in that street obstructed it. Imagine, then, a
semicircle of which my distance should be a radius,
and that it was filled with auditors, to each of whom
I allowed two square feet, I computed that he might
well be heard by more than thirty thousand people."</p>

<p>But not only does Franklin bear witness of Whitefield's
eloquence as to his voice, but still more strongly
as to its <em>persuasiveness</em>, of which, it seems, he was
himself a striking illustration. He says, "I refused
to contribute to his orphan-house in Georgia, thinking
it injudiciously located. Soon after, I happened
to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which
I perceived he intended to finish with a collection,
and I silently resolved he should get nothing from
me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money,
three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in
gold. As he proceeded, I began to soften, and determined
to give the copper. Another stroke of his
oratory made me ashamed of that, and determined me
to give the silver; and he finished so admirably, that
I emptied my pocket wholly into the collector's dish,
gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of
our club; who being of my sentiments respecting the
building at Georgia, and suspecting a collection might
be intended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
before he came from home. Towards the conclusion
of the discourse, however, he felt a strong inclination
to give, and applied to a neighbor, who stood near
him, to lend him some money for the purpose. The
request was made to, perhaps, the only man in the
company who had the firmness not to be affected by
the preacher. His answer was, 'At any other time,
friend Hodgkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but
not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right
senses.'"</p>

<p>Whitefield, much as he loved Philadelphia, had
now again to leave it. Thus writes the correspondent
of the "New England Weekly Journal," at Newcastle,
May 15: "This evening Mr. Whitefield went
on board his sloop here, to sail for Georgia. On Sunday
he preached twice In Philadelphia, and in the
evening, when he preached his farewell sermon, it is
supposed he had twenty thousand hearers. On Monday
he preached at Darby and Chester; on Tuesday,
at Wilmington and White Clay creek; on Wednesday,
twice at Nottingham; on Thursday, at Fog's
Manor and Newcastle. The congregations were much
increased since his being here last. The presence of
God was much seen in the assemblies, especially at
Nottingham and Fog's Manor, where the people were
under such deep soul distress, that their cries almost
drowned his voice. He has collected in this and the
neighboring provinces, about &#163;450 sterling for his
orphans in Georgia."</p>

<p>He arrived at Savannah June 5, and most interesting
was the manner of his reception. He says, "O
what a sweet meeting I had with my dear friends!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
What God has prepared for me, I know not; but
surely I cannot well expect a greater happiness, till
I embrace the saints in glory. When I parted, my
heart was ready to break with sorrow; but now it
almost bursts with joy. O how did each in turn
hang upon my neck, kiss, and weep over me with
tears of joy! And my own soul was so full of a sense
of God's love when I embraced one friend in particular,
that I thought I should have expired in the place.
I felt my soul so full of a sense of the divine goodness,
that I wanted words to express myself. Why me,
Lord; why me? When we came to public worship,
young and old were all dissolved in tears. After
service, several of my parishioners, all my family, and
the little children, returned home, crying along the
streets, and some could not avoid praying very loud.</p>

<p>"Being very weak in body, I laid myself upon a
bed; but finding so many weeping, I rose and betook
myself to prayer again. But had I not lifted up my
voice very high, the groans and cries of the children
would have prevented my being heard. This continued
for near an hour; till at last, finding their
concern rather increase than abate, I desired all to retire.
Then some or other might be heard praying earnestly,
in every corner of the house. It happened at
this time to thunder and lighten, which added very
much to the solemnity of the night. Next day the
concern still continued, especially among the girls. I
mention the orphans in particular, that their benefactors
may rejoice in what God is doing for their souls."</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, he wrote, "I have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with me a Latin master, and on Monday laid the
foundation, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for a university
in Georgia." On the 28th of the same month,
he wrote to a Mr. W. D&mdash;&mdash;, in a style admirably
corresponding with the meek spirit we have already
seen in his letter to the Rev. Dr. Pemberton, of New
York. "I thank you for your kind letters and friendly
cautions; and I trust I shall always reckon those
my choicest friends, who, in simplicity and meekness,
tell me the corruptions of my heart. It is that faithfulness
which has endeared J. S&mdash;&mdash; to me. I think
I never was obliged to any one so much before. O
my dear brother, still continue faithful to my soul;
do not hate me in your heart; in any wise reprove
me. Exhort all my brethren to forgive my past, I
fear, too imperious carriage; and let them pray that
I may know myself to be, what I really am, less than
the least of them all."</p>

<p>Whitefield's family at Bethesda had now increased
to not less than one hundred and fifty persons, and to
advance their interests, it was needful that he should
again visit Charleston, where he arrived on the third
of July, and immediately commenced preaching, as on
former visits. On the following Sabbath, three days
after his arrival, he attended the Episcopal church,
where, he says, "I heard the commissary preach as
virulent and unorthodox, inconsistent a discourse, as
ever I heard in my life. His heart seemed full of
choler and resentment. Out of the abundance thereof,
he poured forth so many bitter words against the
Methodists, as he called them, in general, and me in
particular, that several who intended to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sacrament at his hands, withdrew. Never, I believe,
was such a preparation sermon preached before. After
sermon, he sent his clerk to desire me not to come
to the sacrament till he had spoken with me. I immediately
retired to my lodgings, rejoicing that I was
accounted worthy to suffer this further degree of contempt
for my dear Lord's sake."</p>

<p>The next day, the commissary of the bishop of
London issued against Whitefield the following ecclesiastical
writ:</p>

<p>"Alexander Garden, lawfully constituted Commissary
of the Right Reverend Father in Christ, Edmund,
by divine permission Lord Bishop of London,
supported by the royal authority underwritten:</p>

<p>"Alexander Garden, To all and singular clerks,
and literate persons whomsoever, in and throughout
the whole province of South Carolina, wheresoever
appointed, Greeting:</p>

<p>"To you, conjunctly and severally, we commit, and
strictly enjoining, command, that you do cite, or cause
to be cited, peremptorily, George Whitefield, clerk,
and presbyter of the Church of England, that he lawfully
appear before us, in the parish church of St.
Philip, Charleston, and in the judicial place of the
same, on Tuesday, the fifteenth day of this instant
July, 'twixt the hours of nine and ten in the forenoon,
then and there in justice to answer to certain articles,
heads, or interrogatories, which will be objected and
ministered unto him concerning the mere health of
his soul, and the reformation and correction of his
manners and excesses, and chiefly for omitting to use
the form of prayers prescribed in the Communion-Book;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and further to do and receive what shall be
just in that behalf, on pain of law and contempt. And
what you shall do in the premises, you shall duly certify
us, together with these presents.</p>

<p>"Given under our hands and seals of our office, at
Charleston, this seventh day of July, in the year of our
Lord one thousand seven hundred and forty."</p>

<p>Justice to all parties requires it should be said,
that the phrase as to the health of Whitefield's <em>soul</em>
was used by Garden not of choice, but in conformity
with the forms of English ecclesiastical law; the
theory of which is, that ecclesiastical courts are only
held to promote the spiritual health or welfare of
those who are cited into them. The principal sin of
Whitefield was "omitting to use the form of prayer
prescribed in the Common Prayer Book." The undisputed
matter of fact, as Tracy says, was, that he
always used that form when he could obtain an Episcopal
church to preach in; but when he was shut out
of such pulpits, and was preaching to Baptists, Presbyterians,
and Congregationalists, in their own houses
of worship, where none of the congregations had
prayer books, or knew how to use them, and where
the introduction of unaccustomed forms would not
have promoted the devotion of the worshippers, he
prayed extempore.</p>

<p>On the day this writ was issued, Whitefield preached
for Mr. Chanler, "a gracious Baptist minister,
about fourteen miles from Charleston;" and twice on
the next day "to a large audience in Mr. Osgood's
meeting-house, a young Independent minister," at Dorchester;
the next day at Dorchester again, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Charleston in the evening; the next day preached and
read prayers in Christ's church, and twice at Charleston
the next day, with great success. And now, on
July 11th, a citation was served upon him to appear
on the fifteenth, as required in the writ.</p>

<p>On the 12th, he preached and read prayers twice
on John's island; and on the 13th, which was the
Sabbath, he again listened to a sermon from the commissary.
Of this sermon Whitefield says, "Had some
infernal spirit been sent to draw my picture, I think
it scarcely possible that he could paint me in more
horrid colors. I think, if ever, then was the time that
all manner of evil was spoken against me falsely for
Christ's sake. The commissary seemed to ransack
church history for instances of enthusiasm and abused
grace. He drew a parallel between me and all the
Oliverians, Ranters, Quakers, French prophets, till he
came down to a family of Dutartes, who lived not
many years ago in South Carolina, and were guilty
of the most notorious incests and murders."</p>

<p>The next day Whitefield again preached twice;
and on Tuesday appeared before the commissary, according
to his citation. This is said to have been
the first court of the kind ever attempted to be held
in any of the colonies. It consisted of the reverend
commissary A. Garden, and the Rev. Messrs. Guy,
Mellichamp, Roe, and Orr, who, as well as Whitefield
himself, and his able advocate, Mr. Andrew Rutledge,
respectively showed their want of familiarity with
such business, and, after a series of blunders on both
sides, the court adjourned to nine o'clock the next
morning, to afford Whitefield time to ascertain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
extent of the jurisdiction of the bishop and his commissary.
How little, however, he studied the subject
may be inferred from the fact, that he preached twice
during the remainder of the day. The next day, a
Mr. Graham appeared as a prosecuting attorney, and
Mr. Rutledge as counsel for the respondent. Whitefield
made some mistakes, but hints from his quick-sighted
advocate and his own adroitness saved him
from their consequences; though he contrived to give
the court a lecture on the meanness of catching at a
word as soon as it was out of his lips, without allowing
him time to correct it. He now filed his objection
against being judged by the commissary, who, he
alleged, was prejudiced against him. This gave rise
to new questions: the court adjourned; and the
evangelist went to James' island, read prayers, and
preached. The next day he again appeared in court,
and found that his exceptions were repelled, and that
the arbitrators he had asked for would not be appointed.
He now appealed to the high Court of
Chancery in London, declaring all further proceedings
in this court to be null and void. He then retired
and read letters which refreshed his spirit, by
informing him how "mightily grew the word of God
and prevailed" at Philadelphia; and that Mr. Bolton,
in Georgia, had nearly fifty negroes learning to
read. On the 18th he preached twice, and on the
19th again appeared before the commissary, and
bound himself, in a penalty of ten pounds, to prosecute
his appeal in London within twelve months. The
appeal was never tried, as the ecclesiastical authorities
allowed it to die of neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"The court being ended," says Whitefield, in his
journal, "the commissary desired to speak with me.
I asked him to my lodgings. He chose to walk on a
green near the church. His spirit was somewhat
calmer than usual; but after an hour's conversation,
we were as far from agreeing as before." "All his
discourse was so inconsistent and contrary to the gospel
of our Lord, that I was obliged to tell him that I
believed him to be an unconverted man, an enemy to
God, and of a like spirit with the persecutor Saul.
At this he smiled; and, after we had talked a long
while, we parted, and God gave me great satisfaction
that I had delivered my soul in my private conversation
with the commissary."</p>

<p>The next day, July 20, was the Sabbath. The
commissary preached in his usual style, and Whitefield
preached his farewell sermon to the people of
Charleston. By his recommendation two or three of
the dissenting ministers had instituted a weekly lecture;
and the evangelist "advised the people, as the
gospel was not preached in church, to go and hear it
in the meeting-house." On leaving the city, he summed
up, in his journal, the results of his labors in this
manner:</p>

<p>"What makes the change more remarkable in the
Charleston people is, that they seemed to me, at my
first coming, to be a people wholly devoted to pleasure.
One well acquainted with their manners and
circumstances, told me more had been spent on polite
entertainments, than the poor's-rate came to; but now
the jewellers and dancing-masters begin to cry out
that their craft is in danger. A vast alteration is discernible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in the ladies' dresses. And some, while I
have been speaking, have been so convinced of the sin
of wearing jewels, that I have seen them with blushes
put their hands to their ears, and cover them with
their fans. But I hope the reformation has gone farther
than externals. Many moral, good sort of men,
who before were settled on their lees, have been gloriously
awakened to seek after Jesus Christ; and
many a Lydia's heart hath been opened to receive the
things that were spoken. Indeed, the word came like
a hammer and a fire. And a door, I believe, will be
opened for teaching the poor negroes. Several of
them have done their usual work in less time, that
they might come to hear me. Many of their owners,
who have been awakened, resolved to teach them
Christianity. Had I time, and proper schoolmasters,
I might immediately erect a negro school in South
Carolina, as well as in Pennsylvania. Many would
willingly contribute both money and land."</p>

<p>The Baptist church in Charleston at this time was
nearly extinct, being reduced to five or six communicants,
but Whitefield's success greatly increased their
number, and it thus gained strength which it has never
lost. It is also gratefully mentioned even now by the
church of that denomination at Eutaw, that Whitefield
during this visit to South Carolina preached the dedication-sermon
of their house of worship.</p>

<p>Whitefield left Charleston on July 21, visiting and
preaching on his way homeward, which he reached
towards the close of the same week. He preached on
the Sabbath in extreme weakness of body, but "with
the Holy Ghost from above," and several were hopefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
converted to God. On the 18th of August, he
again left Savannah for Charleston, where he was
able, for want of bodily strength, to preach but once
a day, but he thought that his sermons were attended
with more power and success than ever before. In a
few days after, having preached a farewell sermon to
four thousand hearers, he sailed for New England,
where he had been very cordially invited by leading
ministers and others in Boston and many other places.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>WHITEFIELD'S FIRST VISIT TO NEW ENGLAND.<br />

SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER, 1740.</h3>


<p>The religious state of New England in the early
part of the eighteenth century, was little better than
the description we have already given of the state
of Great Britain and its other dependencies at that
period. Dr. Prince tells us, that the first age of
New England was one of an almost continual revival.
Preaching was attended with so much power in some
places, "that it was a common inquiry, by such members
of a family as were detained at home on a Sabbath,
whether any had been visibly awakened in the
house of God that day." And he adds, "Few Sabbaths
did pass without some being evidently converted,
and some convincing proof of the power of God
accompanying his word."</p>

<p>Dr. Increase Mather, writing towards the close of
the seventeenth century, while he confirms the statements
we have already given, bears farther testimony
which is of a very painful character. He says, "Prayer
is necessary on this account, that conversions have
become rare in this age of the world. They that have
their thoughts exercised in discerning things of this
nature, have sad apprehensions that the work of conversion
has come to a stand. During the last age
scarcely a sermon was preached without some being
apparently converted, and sometimes hundreds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
converted by one sermon. Who of us now can say
that we have seen any thing such as this? Clear,
sound conversions are not frequent in our congregations;
the great bulk of the present generation are
apparently poor, perishing, and if the Lord prevent
not, undone; many are profane, drunkards, lascivious,
scoffers at the power of godliness, and disobedient;
others are civil and outwardly conformed to good order,
because so educated, but without knowing aught
of a real change of heart." The same estimable writer
says, in 1721, "I am now in my eighty-third year, and
having had an opportunity of conversing with the first
planters of this country, and having been for <em>sixty-five</em>
years a preacher of the gospel, I feel as did the ancient
men who had seen the former temple, and who wept
aloud as they saw the latter. The children of New
England are, or once were, for the most part, the children
of godly parents. What did our fathers come
into this wilderness for? Not to gain estates as men
do now, but for religion, and that they might have
their children in a hopeful way of being truly religious.
There was a famous man who preached before
one of the greatest assemblies that ever was addressed;
it was about seventy years ago; and he said to
them, 'I lived in a country seven years, and all that
time I never heard a profane oath, or saw a man
drunk.' And where was that country? It was New
England. Ah, degenerate New England! What art
thou come to at this day? How are those sins become
common that were once not even heard of!"</p>

<p>Passing over, for the present, indications of a revival
of religion, which had appeared in other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the country, we speak now only of New England.
In 1734, a very extraordinary work of grace appeared
at Northampton, Massachusetts, under the ministry of
the distinguished Jonathan Edwards, the elder, the
history of which is given in his admirable "Narrative
of the surprising Work of God" at that period, in
Northampton and the vicinity.</p>

<p>It is important to remark here, that the preaching
which led to such delightful results was of the most
faithful and pungent character. We will give one instance,
as illustrative of many, as will be distinctly seen
by those who have read <span class="smcap">Edwards'</span> sermon, "<cite>Sinners in
the hands of an angry God</cite>," or his "<cite>Justice of God in the
damnation of Sinners</cite>." Perhaps, however, no sermon
in New England has ever acquired greater celebrity,
or accomplished more good, than the one preached
by President Edwards at Enfield, July 8, 1741, from
the words, "Their feet shall slide in due time." Deut.
32:35. "When they went into the meeting-house,
the appearance of the assembly was thoughtless and
vain; the people scarcely conducted themselves with
common decency." But as the sermon proceeded, the
audience became so overwhelmed with distress and
weeping, that the preacher was "obliged to speak to
the people and desire silence, that he might be heard."
The excitement soon became intense; and it is said
that a minister who sat in the pulpit with Mr. Edwards,
in the agitation of his feelings, caught the
preacher by the skirt of his dress, and said, "Mr.
Edwards, Mr. Edwards, is not God a God of mercy?"
Many of the hearers were seen unconsciously holding
themselves up against the pillars, and the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pews, as though they already felt themselves sliding
into the pit. This fact has often been mentioned as
a proof of the strong and scriptural character of President
Edwards' peculiar eloquence&mdash;the eloquence of
truth as attended by influence from heaven; for his
sermons were read, without gestures.</p>

<p>But there was another element which must be
taken into account when we look at the result of this
sermon, as well as others delivered in like circumstances,
and one which we fear has been often overlooked.
"While the people of the neighboring towns
were in great distress about their souls, the inhabitants
of Enfield were very secure, loose, and vain. A lecture
had been appointed there, and the neighboring
people were so affected at the thoughtlessness of the
inhabitants, and had so much fear that God would, in
his righteous judgment, pass them by, that many of
them were prostrate before him a considerable part
of the previous evening, supplicating the mercy of
heaven in their behalf. And when the time appointed
for the lecture came, a number of the surrounding
ministers were present, as well as some from a distance"&mdash;a
proof of the prayerful interest felt on behalf
of the town. In all this we see much of the
secret of the powerful impression produced by that
sermon, and are taught that in seasons when God
seems about to pour out his Spirit on a community,
Christians should be found "continuing instant in
prayer."</p>

<p>In this more hopeful state of things than had long
before existed in New England, Whitefield, who was
now the second time in America, was most urgently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
entreated to visit the descendants of the Pilgrim fathers.
He complied with the request, and arrived at
Newport on the evening of the Sabbath, September
14, 1740. We furnish an account, written chiefly by
himself, in his journal, published in London, 1741, a
copy of which may be found in the library of Harvard
University, to which we have had a kind access, and
which is rich in what we may term <em>Whitefieldian lore</em>.
He writes,</p>

<p>"Was sick part of the passage, but found afterwards
the sea-air, under God, much improved my
health. Arrived at Newport, in Rhode Island, just
after the beginning of evening service. We came
purposely thither first with our sloop. I think it the
most pleasant entrance I ever yet saw. Almost all
the morning the wind was contrary; but I found a
very strong inclination to pray that we might arrive
time enough to be present at public worship. Once I
called the people; but something prevented their coming.
At last, finding my impression increase upon me,
I desired their attendance immediately. They came.
With a strong assurance that we should be heard, we
prayed that the Lord would turn the wind, that we
might give him thanks in the great congregation;
and also that he would send such to us as he would
have us to converse with, and who might show us a
lodging. Though the wind was ahead when we began,
when we had done praying, and came up out of
the cabin, it was quite fair.</p>

<p>"With a gentle gale we sailed most pleasantly
into the harbor; got into public worship before they
had finished the psalms; and sat, as I thought, undiscovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
After service was over, a gentleman asked
me whether my name was not Whitefield. I told
him 'yes;' he then desired me to go to his house, and
he would take care to provide lodgings and necessaries
for me and my friends. I went, silently admiring
God's goodness in answering my prayer so minutely.
Several gentlemen of the town soon came to
pay their respects to me, among whom was one Mr.
Clap, an aged dissenting minister, but the most venerable
man I ever saw. He looked like a good old
Puritan, and gave me an idea of what stamp those men
were who first settled New England. His countenance
was very heavenly; he rejoiced much in spirit
at the sight of me, and prayed most affectionately for
a blessing on my coming to Rhode Island."</p>

<p>In the evening, in company with Mr. Clap and
other friends, Whitefield visited Mr. Honeyman, the
minister of the church of England, and requested the
use of his pulpit. "At first he seemed a little unwilling,
being desirous to know 'what extraordinary call
I had to preach on week-days,' which he said was
disorderly. I answered, 'St. Paul exhorted Timothy
to 'be instant in season and out of season;' that if the
orders of the church were rightly complied with, our
ministers should read public prayers twice every day,
and then it would not be disorderly at such times to
give them a sermon. As to an extraordinary call, I
claimed none otherwise than upon the apostle's injunction,
'As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all
men.' He still held out, and did not give any positive
answer; but at last, after he had withdrawn and consulted
with the gentlemen, he said, 'If my preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
would promote the glory of God, and the good of
souls, I was welcome to his church as often as I
would, during my stay in town.' We then agreed to
make use of it at ten in the morning, and three in the
afternoon. After this, I went to wait on the governor,
who seemed to be a very plain man, and had a very
plain house, which much pleased me. By profession,
I think he is a Seventh-day Baptist; he is a man of
good report as to his conduct and dealing with the
world." As might have been expected, the evening
was spent in exposition and prayer, with a crowded
company, in the house of his friend Bowers, the gentleman
who first addressed him when coming out of
church.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, he breakfasted with "old
Mr. Clap, and was much edified by his conversation."
Of this venerable servant of Christ he says, "I could
not but think, while at his table, that I was sitting
with one of the patriarchs. He is full of days, a
bachelor, and has been minister of a congregation in
Rhode Island upwards of forty years. People of all
denominations, I find, respect him. He abounds in
good works; gives all away, and is wonderfully tender
of little children; many of different persuasions come
to be instructed by him. Whenever he dies, I am
persuaded, with good old Simeon, he will be enabled
to say, 'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace.'" Whitefield preached, according to appointment,
morning and afternoon, "in the church. It is
very commodious, and I believe will contain three
thousand people. It was more than filled in the afternoon.
Persons of all denominations attended. God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
assisted me much. I observed numbers affected, and
had great reason to believe the word of the Lord had
been 'sharper than a twoedged sword,' in some of the
hearers' souls."</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day he received the
following note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir and beloved Brother</span>&mdash;Although
mine eyes never saw your face before this day, yet my
heart and soul have been united to you in love, by
the bond of the Spirit. I have longed and expected
to see you for many months past. Blessed be God,
mine eyes have seen the joyful day. I trust, through
grace, I have some things to communicate to you that
will make your heart glad. I shall omit writing any
thing, and only hereby present my hearty love, and
let you know that I am waiting now at the post of
your door for admission. Though I am unworthy,
my Lord is worthy, in whose name, I trust, I come. I
am your unworthy brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
"JONATHAN BARBER."
</p></blockquote>

<p>"On reading it," says Whitefield, "I could not but
think this was one of those young ministers whom
God had lately made use of in such a remarkable
manner, at the east end of Long Island. I sent for
him, and found he was the man. My heart rejoiced.
We walked out, and took sweet counsel together; and
among other things, he told me that he came to
Rhode Island under a full conviction that he should
see me there, and had been waiting for me about a
week.... What rendered this more remarkable was,
I had no intention of sailing to Rhode Island till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
about three days before I left Carolina; and I had a
great desire to put in, if I could, at the east end of
Long Island, to see this very person, whom the great
God now brought unto me. Lord, accept our thanks,
sanctify our meeting, and teach us both what we shall
do for thine own name's sake. In the evening I went
to the venerable Mr. Clap's, and exhorted and prayed
with a great multitude, who not only crowded into the
house, but thronged every way about it. The dear
old man rejoiced to see the things which he saw; and
after my exhortation was over, dismissed me with his
blessing."</p>

<p>Tuesday, we scarcely need remark, was spent by
Whitefield in the work of his great Master. He
preached to a vast congregation, including the members
of the House of Assembly, who adjourned to
attend the service; and he had very delightful evidence
that his labors had already been useful. On
Wednesday he left Newport, and about noon preached
at Bristol, at the request of the court, which was then
in session, and slept that night at a hotel on the road
to Boston. On Thursday morning he set out early,
and as he passed on with his friends, he says, "Found
that the people were apprized of my coming, and were
solicitous for my preaching; but being resolved under
God, if possible, to reach Boston, we travelled on for
near fifty miles, and came to Boston about eight in the
evening. When we were within four miles of the
city, the governor's son, several other gentlemen, and
one or two ministers, waited at a gentleman's house
to give me the meeting. They received me with great
gladness, and told me many more would have come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had not a large funeral been in the town, or if there
had been more certain notice of my arriving. This
rejoiced me; for I think I can stand any thing better
than this. It savors too much of human grandeur.
But I must be tried every way; the Lord be my
helper. After stopping a while, we went together to
Boston, to the house of one Mr. Sandiford, brother-in-law
to the Rev. Dr. Colman, who long since had
sent me an invitation.... My heart was but low, and
my body weak; but, at the request of one of the ministers,
I gave thanks to our gracious God for bringing
me in safety, and prayed that my coming might be in
the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of peace."</p>

<p>He slept well that night, and the next morning, he
says, "I perceived fresh emanations of divine light
break in upon and refresh my soul." He was visited
by several gentlemen, including Josiah Willard, Esq.,
the secretary of the province, a man who feared God,
and with whom Whitefield had for some time been in
correspondence. The governor, Belcher, received him
with the utmost respect, and requested frequent visits.
He attended public worship at the church of England,
and waited on the commissary home, who received
him very courteously. As it was a day on which the
clergy of that body had a meeting, he came into the
company of five of them assembled together. They
soon attacked him "for calling <em>that Tennent</em> and his
brethren faithful ministers of Christ." He answered,
that he believed they were so. They questioned the validity
of Presbyterian ordination, and quoted from his
journal his own words against him. He replied, that
perhaps his sentiments were altered. They then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
into a doctrinal discussion, which continued till Whitefield,
finding how inconsistent they were, took his
leave, resolving that they should not have the opportunity
of denying him their pulpits. However, they
treated him, on the whole, with more courtesy than
he had lately been accustomed to receive from the
ministers of his own church.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day, he preached to
a vast congregation in the Rev. Dr. Colman's meeting-house,
in Brattle-street, and in the evening exhorted
and prayed with such as came to his lodgings. On
Saturday, in the forenoon, he discoursed to a crowded
audience at the Old South church, where Dr. Sewall
was pastor, the only church edifice in Boston with
which Whitefield was connected which is still standing
as it then was. In the afternoon he preached on
the Common to about eight thousand persons, and, at
night to a thronged company at his own lodgings.</p>

<p>On the morning of the next day, which was the
Sabbath, he heard Dr. Colman preach; in the afternoon,
he preached at Mr. Foxcroft's meeting-house to
a vast auditory. This gentleman was the senior pastor
of the First church, meeting in Chauncy-place, and
the Rev. Charles Chauncy was his colleague. The
church edifice was in Cornhill-square, not far from
the old state-house, and was usually called the "Old
Brick meeting." As this house was by far too small
to contain his auditory, he almost immediately afterwards
preached on the Common, to about fifteen thousand
hearers; and again at night at his lodgings.
He says, "Some afterwards came into my room. I
felt much of the divine presence in my own soul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
though hoarse was enabled to speak with much power,
and could have spoke, I believe, till midnight."</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Whitefield preached at Mr.
Webb's meeting-house, the "New North," on the corner
of Clark and Hanover streets. "The presence of
the Lord," he says, "was among us. Look where I
would around me, visible impressions were made upon
the auditory. Most wept for a considerable time."
In the afternoon he meant to have preached at Mr.
Cheekley's, in Summer-street, but was prevented by
an accident. Just before the time for the commencement
of the service, a person broke a board in one of
the galleries, of which to make a seat; the noise
alarmed some who heard it, and they imprudently
cried out that the galleries were giving way. The
house being much crowded, the whole congregation
were thrown into the utmost alarm and disorder;
some jumped from the gallery into the seats below,
others fell from the windows, and those below pressing
to get out of the porch, were many of them thrown
over each other and trodden upon. Many, as might
be expected, were seriously bruised; others had bones
broken; and within two days five persons died from
the injuries they had received. Mr. Whitefield's presence
of mind did not fail him; he immediately led
the anxious throng to the Common, and preached to
them from the text, "Go ye out into the highways
and hedges, and compel them to come in." He says,
"The weather was wet, but above eight thousand followed
into the fields."</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, Whitefield visited Mr. Walter,
at Roxbury. This gentleman had been the colleague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and was now the successor of John Eliot,
"the apostle of the Indians." These two men had
been pastors of that church one hundred and six years.
Whitefield was much pleased with Walter, who, in
return, was glad to hear that he, like old Bishop Beveridge,
called man "half a devil and half a beast."
He preached that forenoon at Mr. Gee's meeting-house,
the "Old North," of which church the celebrated
Dr. Cotton Mather had formerly been pastor. The
house stood in the North square, and was taken down
by the British army and burned for fuel at the siege
of Boston, in 1776. The auditory Whitefield preached
to that morning was not very crowded, as the people
were in doubt where he would preach. After
dining with the secretary of the province, he says, "I
preached in the afternoon at Dr. Sewall's to a thronged
congregation, and exhorted and prayed as usual at
my own lodgings; at neither place without some manifestations
of a divine power accompanying the word."</p>

<p>Wednesday was not lost. Whitefield himself shall
describe its proceedings. "Went this morning to see
and preach at Cambridge, the chief college for training
up the sons of the prophets in all New England.
It has one president, I think four tutors, and about a
hundred students. It is scarce as big as one of our
least colleges in Oxford, and as far as I could gather
from some who well knew the state of it, not far superior
to our universities in piety and true godliness.
Tutors neglect to pray with, and examine the hearts
of their pupils. Discipline is at too low an ebb. Bad
books are become fashionable. Tillotson and Clarke
are read instead of Sheppard, Stoddard, and such like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
evangelical writers; and therefore I chose to preach
on these words: 'We are not as many, who corrupt the
word of God;' and in the conclusion of my sermon I
made a close application to tutors and students. A
great number of neighboring ministers attended, as
indeed they do at all other times, and God gave me
great boldness and freedom of speech. The president
of the college and minister of the parish treated me
very civilly. In the afternoon I preached again in
the court, without any particular application to the
students. I believe there were about seven thousand
hearers. The Holy Spirit melted many hearts. The
word was attended with a manifest power; and a
minister soon after wrote me word, that 'he believed
one of his daughters was savingly wrought upon at that
time.' Paid my respects to the lieutenant-governor, who
lives at Cambridge, and returned in the evening to Boston,
and prayed with and exhorted many people who
were waiting round the door for a spiritual morsel.
I believe our Lord did not send them empty away."</p>

<p>An elm under which Whitefield preached in Cambridge
became distinguished; it being under its shade
that Washington, thirty-one years after, first drew his
sword in the cause of the Revolution, on taking the
command of the American army. From this circumstance,
it has been called the "Washington elm." The
last time the late distinguished Dr. Holyoke, of Salem,
Mass., was in Cambridge, then nearly a hundred years
old, while passing this tree with a friend, he said that
he heard Whitefield's sermon, being at the time a student
in college.</p>

<p>On Thursday he preached the weekly lecture at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Mr. Foxcroft's, the First church. But he says, "I
was so oppressed with a sense of my base ingratitude
to my dearest Saviour, that Satan would fain have
tempted me to hold my tongue, and not invite poor
sinners to Jesus Christ, because I was so great a sinner
myself. But God enabled me to withstand the
temptation, and since Jesus Christ had shown such
mercy to, and had not withdrawn his Holy Spirit from
me, the chief of sinners, I was enabled more feelingly
to talk of his love; and afterwards found that one
stranger, in particular, was in all probability effectually
convinced by that morning's sermon. After public
worship, I went, at his excellency's invitation, and
dined with the governor. Most of the ministers of
the town were invited with me. Before dinner, the
governor sent for me up into his chamber. He wept,
wished me 'good luck in the name of the Lord,' and
recommended himself, ministers, and people to my
prayers. Immediately after dinner, I prayed explicitly
for them all, and went in his coach to the end of
the town; but had such a sense of my vileness upon
my soul, that I wondered people did not stone me.
Crossed a ferry, and preached at Charlestown, a town
lying on the north side of Boston. The meeting-house
was very capacious, and quite filled. A gracious melting
was discernible through the whole congregation,
and I perceived much freedom and sweetness in my
own soul, though the damp I felt in the morning was
not quite gone off. In the evening I exhorted and
prayed as usual at my lodgings; and blessed be God,
I found a great alteration in my hearers. They now
began to melt and weep under the word."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>On Friday, the following day, he preached in the
morning at Roxbury, from a little ascent, to many
thousands of people, with much of the divine presence.
Several came to him afterwards, telling him how they
were struck with the word. Having dined with Judge
Dudley, he preached to a still larger congregation
from a scaffold erected outside Mr. Byles' meeting-house
in Hollis-street. Wrote to several friends in
England; gave a short exhortation to a large crowd
of hearers; and then spent the evening with several
ministers in edifying conversation, singing, and prayer.</p>

<p>Saturday, he preached in the morning at Mr. Welsteed's
meeting-house, and in the afternoon to about
fifteen thousand people on the Common. "But Oh,
how did the word run! It rejoiced me to see such
numbers greatly affected, so that some, I believe, could
scarcely abstain from crying out. That place was no
other than a Bethel, and a gate of heaven." After
he had gone home to his lodgings he says, "The power
and presence of the Lord accompanied and followed
me. Many now wept bitterly, and cried out under
the word like persons that were really hungering and
thirsting after righteousness; and after I left them,
God gave me to wrestle with him in my chamber, in
behalf of some dear friends then present, and others
that were absent from us. The Spirit of the Lord
was upon them all. It made intercession with groanings
that cannot be uttered."</p>

<p>On the day following, being the Sabbath, in the
morning he preached at the Old South church, Dr.
Sewall's, to a very crowded auditory, "with almost as
much power and visible appearance of God as yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Collected &#163;555 currency for my little lambs;
was taken very ill after dinner; vomited violently,
but was enabled to preach at Dr. Colman's in the
afternoon to as great, if not a greater congregation
than in the morning. Here also &#163;470 were collected
for the orphan-house in Georgia. In both places all
things were carried on with decency and order. People
went slowly out, as though they had not a mind
to escape giving; and Dr. Colman said 'it was the
most pleasant time he ever enjoyed in that meeting-house
through the whole course of his life.' Blessed
be God, after sermon I perceived myself somewhat
refreshed. Supped very early. Had the honor of a
private visit from the governor, who came full of affection
to take his leave of me for the present. Went,
at their request, and preached to a great company of
negroes, on the conversion of the Ethiopian, Acts the
eighth; at which the poor creatures, as well as many
white people, were much affected; and at my return,
gave an exhortation to a crowd of people who were
waiting at my lodgings. My animal spirits were
almost exhausted, and my legs, through expense of
sweating and vomiting, almost ready to sink under
me; but the Lord visited my soul, and I went to bed
greatly refreshed with divine consolations." Even at
this early period such sufferings of his bodily system
frequently followed his herculean labors.</p>

<p>Early on Monday morning, Sept. 29, Whitefield
left Boston on an excursion to the eastward. At
Marblehead, he "preached to some thousands in a
broad place in the middle of the town, but not with
much apparent effect." At Salem, he "preached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
about seven thousand people. Here the Lord manifested
forth his glory. One man was, I believe, struck
down by the power of the word. In every part of the
congregation, persons might be seen under great concern."
He went on to Ipswich, where he was kindly
"entertained at the house of Mr. Rogers, one of the
ministers of the place." Of this family our evangelist
was soon to know more than he had hitherto done.
At about this period, John Rogers, aged 77, and
Nathanael Rogers, were joint pastors of the First
church at Ipswich; both of them were ardent promoters
of the revival, as was also Daniel Rogers, of
the same family. Whitefield learned with deep interest
that his host was a descendant of the celebrated
martyr, John Rogers. The next day he preached
there to some thousands. "The Lord," says he, "gave
me freedom, and there was a great melting in the congregation."
At Newbury, in the afternoon, the Lord
accompanied the word with power. The meeting-house
was very large, many ministers were present,
and the people were greatly affected. Blessed be
God, his divine power attends us more and more."
Wednesday, he preached at Hampton, in the open air,
to some thousands. He was here very highly gratified
with the conversation of Mr. Colton, the minister,
and with the Christian simplicity of his excellent
wife. The high wind prevented his being heard so
well as he usually was, and he did not enjoy his accustomed
freedom; still, "some, though not many, were
affected." At Portsmouth, he "preached to a polite
auditory, but so very unconcerned, that I began to
question whether I had been speaking to rational or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
brute creatures. Seeing no immediate effects of the
word preached, I was a little dejected; but God, to
comfort my heart, sent one young man, crying out in
great anguish of spirit, 'What shall I do to be saved?'"</p>

<p>From Portsmouth, our evangelist proceeded to
York, in Maine, "to see one Mr. Moody, a worthy,
plain, and powerful minister of Jesus Christ, though
now much impaired by old age. He has lived by
faith for many years, would have no settled salary,
and has been much despised by bad men, and as much
respected by the true lovers of the blessed Jesus."
The next morning he was much comforted to hear,
from Mr. Moody, that he would preach that morning
to a hundred new creatures; "and indeed," says he,
"I believe I did; for when I came to preach, I could
speak little or no terror, but most consolation." He
preached morning and evening. "The hearers looked
plain and simple, and the tears trickled apace down
most of their cheeks." He returned to Portsmouth
that night, and the next morning preached to a far
greater congregation, and with much better effect than
before. "Instead of preaching to dead stocks, I now
had reason to believe I was preaching to living men.
People began to melt soon after I began to pray;
and the power increased more and more during the
whole sermon." This was still more clearly evinced
after Mr. Whitefield's departure from the town.</p>

<p>Returning to Boston, through Salem, Marblehead,
and Malden, in each of which places he preached, and
being now in improved health, he preached, October 7,
both morning and evening, "with much power," at
Brattle-street. There had been for several days a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
report in circulation, that he had died suddenly, or
was poisoned, and the people greatly rejoiced again
to see him alive. At Mr. Webb's, the New North
church, on the following Wednesday, he thought there
was more of the presence of God through the whole
ministration, than he had before, known at one time
in the course of his life. He went there with the
governor, in his coach, and preached morning and
evening. "Jesus Christ manifested forth his glory;
many hearts melted within them; and I think I was
never drawn out to pray for and invite little children
to Jesus Christ, as I was this morning. A little before,
I had heard of a child who was taken sick just
after it had heard me preach, and said he would go
to Mr. Whitefield's God, and died in a short time.
This encouraged me to speak to the little ones. But
O, how were the old people affected when I said, 'Little
children, if your parents will not come to Christ,
do you come, and go to heaven without them.' There
seemed to be but few dry eyes, look where I would.
I have not seen a greater commotion since my preaching
at Boston. Glory be to God, who has not forgotten
to be gracious." He collected, after this sermon,
&#163;440 for his orphan-house, which was now more
generally supported than ever before.</p>

<p>The interesting fact we have just related of the
impression produced on the mind of a little child by
the preaching of Mr. Whitefield, may afford the opportunity
to introduce one or two other facts bearing on
the same general topic, and suggesting some practical
lessons.</p>

<p>Whitefield could indeed descend to talk with children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Here is a specimen which at once impresses us
with a lively idea of his spirit, and of the adaptation
of the religion of Jesus to the young as well as the
old. A little girl seven years of age, when on her
death-bed, desired an interview with him; he came, and
thus they conversed:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> For what purpose, my dear child,
have you sent for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> I think I am dying, and I wished very
much to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> What can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> You can tell me about Christ, and pray
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> My dear girl, what do you know
about Christ?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> I know he is the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> My dear child, he is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> I hope he will be <em>my</em> Saviour also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> I hope, my dear, that this is the
language of faith out of the mouth of a babe; but tell
me what ground you have for saying this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> Oh, sir, he bids little children, such as I,
to come unto him, and says, "Of such is the kingdom
of heaven;" and besides, I love Christ, and am always
glad when I think of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> My dear child, you make my very
heart to rejoice; but are you not a sinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> Yes, I am a sinner, but my blessed Redeemer
takes away sin, and I long to be with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> My dear girl, I trust that the desire
of your heart will be granted; but where do you
think you will find your Redeemer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> O, sir, I think I shall find him in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> Do you think you will get to heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> Yes, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitefield.</span> But what if you do not find Christ
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> If I do not find Christ there, I am sure it is
not heaven; for where he dwells must be heaven, for
there also dwells God, and holy angels, and all that
Christ saves.</p>

<p>Who can tell the results of a single sermon, or
trace the consequences of one conversion? When
Mr. Whitefield was preaching in New England, a
lady became the subject of divine grace, and her spirit
was peculiarly drawn out in prayer for others. But
in her Christian exercises she was alone; she could
persuade no one to pray with her but her little daughter,
about ten years of age. She took this dear child
into her closet from day to day, as a witness of her
cries and tears. After a time, it pleased God to
touch the heart of the child, and to give her the hope
of salvation by the remission of sin. In a transport
of holy joy she then exclaimed, "O, mother, if all the
world knew this! I wish I could tell every body. Pray,
mother, let me run to some of the neighbors and tell
them, that they may be happy and love my Saviour
too." "Ah, my dear child," said the mother, "that
would be useless, for I suppose that were you to tell
your experience, there is not one within many miles
who would not laugh at you, and say it was all delusion."
"Oh, mother," replied the dear girl, "I think
they would believe me. I must go over to the shoemaker
and tell him; he will believe me." She ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
over, and found him at work in his shop. She began
by telling him that he must die, and that he was a
sinner, and that she was a sinner, but that her blessed
Saviour had heard her mother's prayers, and had forgiven
all her sins; and that now she was so happy
that she did not know how to tell it. The shoemaker
was struck with surprise, his tears flowed down like
rain; he threw aside his work, and by prayer and supplication
sought for mercy. The neighborhood were
awakened, and within a few months more than fifty
persons were brought to the knowledge of Jesus, and
rejoiced in his power and grace.</p>

<p>But to return to our narrative of Whitefield's labors
in Boston. On Thursday, October 9, he preached
the public lecture at the Old South church. He had
selected another text, but it was much impressed on
his heart that he should preach from our Lord's conference
with Nicodemus. A large number of ministers
were present, and when he came to the words,
"Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these
things?" he says, "The Lord enabled me to open my
mouth boldly against unconverted ministers, to caution
tutors to take care of their pupils, and also to advise
ministers particularly to examine into the experiences
of candidates for ordination. For I am verily persuaded
the generality of preachers talk of an unknown
and unfelt Christ; and the reason why congregations
have been so dead is, because they have had dead men
preaching to them. O that the Lord may quicken
and revive them, for his own name's sake. For how
can dead men beget living children? It is true, indeed,
God may convert men by the devil, if he pleases, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
so he may by unconverted ministers; but I believe
he seldom makes use of either of them for this purpose.
No; the Lord will choose vessels made meet
by the operations of the blessed Spirit for his sacred
use: and as for my own part, I would not lay hands
on an unconverted man for ten thousand worlds. Unspeakable
freedom God gave me while treating on
this head. After sermon, I dined with the governor,
who seemed more kindly affected than ever, and particularly
told me, of the minister who has lately begun
to preach extempore, that 'he was glad he had found
out a way to save his eyes.' In the afternoon I preached
on the Common to about fifteen thousand people,
and collected upwards of two hundred pounds for the
orphan-house. Just as I had finished my sermon, a
ticket was put up to me, wherein I was desired to
pray for a person just entered upon the ministry, but
under apprehension that he was not converted. God
enabled me to pray for him with my whole heart; and
I hope that ticket may teach many others not to run
before they can give an account of their conversion.
If they do, they offer to God strange fire." The same
day and evening, Whitefield attended the funeral of
one of the provincial council, preached at the almshouse,
exhorted a great number of persons at the
workhouse, who followed him there, and conversed
with many who waited at his lodgings for spiritual
advice. From the time of his return from the east,
he had been thronged, morning and evening, with
anxious inquirers. His friends cried, "Spare thyself;"
but he says, "I went and ate bread very comfortably
at a friend's house, where I was invited, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
after retired to my rest. Oh, how comfortable is
sleep after working for Jesus."</p>

<p>On Friday he preached at Charlestown and at
Reading to many thousands, and on Saturday from
the meeting-house door at Cambridge, on Noah as a
preacher of righteousness; a great number of persons
were present, who stood very attentively during a
shower of rain, and were at the latter part of the
sermon much affected. On the same afternoon he
returned to Boston, and again preached, and was engaged
till midnight, chiefly in conversation and prayer
with persons anxious for their salvation.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 12, he rose with body and soul
greatly refreshed, and spent its early hours in conversing
with those who came for spiritual counsel.
He then "preached with great power and affection"
at the Old South church, which was so exceedingly
thronged, that he was obliged to get in at one of the
windows. He dined with the governor, who came to
him after dinner weeping, and desired his prayers.
He heard Dr. Sewall in the afternoon. Both during
the exercises and after them he was sick, but went
with the governor in his coach, and preached his farewell
sermon on the Common, Gillies says, to twenty
thousand, and Tracy to nearly thirty thousand people,
though the whole population of Boston did not at that
time exceed twenty thousand. Great multitudes were
melted into tears when he spoke of leaving them.
The governor then went with him to his lodgings.
He stood in the passage and spoke to a great company,
both within and without the doors; but they
were so deeply affected, and cried out so loud, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
he was compelled to leave off praying. The remaining
part of the evening was chiefly spent in conversation
with inquirers.</p>

<p>In closing his account of this day's work, he exclaims,
"Blessed be God for what things he has done
in Boston! I hope a glorious work is now begun,
and that the Lord will stir up some faithful laborers
to carry it on. Boston is a large, populous place,
very wealthy. Has the form kept up, but has lost
much of the power of religion. I have not heard of
any remarkable stir for these many years. Ministers
and people are obliged to confess, that the love of many
is waxed cold. Both, for the generality, seem to be
too much conformed to the world. There is much of
the pride of life to be seen in their assemblies. Jewels,
patches, and gay apparel are commonly worn by the
female sex; and even the common people, I observed
dressed up in the pride of life. There are nine meeting-houses
of the Congregational persuasion, one Baptist,
one French, and one belonging to the Scotch-Irish.
One thing Boston is very remarkable for&mdash;the external
observance of the Sabbath. Men in civil offices
have a regard for religion. The governor encourages
them, and the ministers and magistrates are more
united than in any other place where I have been.
Both were exceedingly civil to me during my stay. I
never saw so little scoffing, never had so little opposition.
But one might easily see much would hereafter
arise, when I came to be more particular in my
application to particular persons; for I fear many
rest in a head-knowledge, are close pharisees, and
have only a name to live. It must needs be so when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the power of godliness is dwindled away, and where
the form only of religion is become fashionable among
people. Boston people are dear to my soul. They
were greatly affected by the word, followed me night
and day, and were very liberal to my dear orphans.
I promised, God willing, to visit them again, and intend
to fulfil my promise when it shall please God to
bring me again from my native country. In the meanwhile,
dear Boston, adieu. The Lord be with thy
ministers and people, and grant that the remnant
which is still left according to the election of grace,
may take root downwards, and bear fruit upwards,
and fill the land."</p>

<p>On the morning following these solemn services,
Whitefield left Boston on his way to Northampton.
To detail his four days' progress, would be almost to
repeat what we have already written. At Concord,
where he arrived on Monday about noon, he preached
twice to some thousands in the open air, "and a comfortable
preaching it was. The hearers were sweetly
melted down." Mr. Bliss, the minister of the town,
of whose subsequent labors it has been well said, more
perfect accounts ought to have been preserved, wept
abundantly. On Tuesday he "preached at Sudbury
to some thousands with power, and observed a considerable
commotion in the assembly;" as was also the
case the same afternoon at Marlborough. At the latter
place he was met by Governor Belcher, who went
with him through the rain that night to Worcester.
Here, on Wednesday, he "preached in the open air to
some thousands. The word fell with weight indeed.
It carried all before it. After sermon, the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
said to me, 'I pray God I may apply what has been
said to my own heart. Pray, Mr. Whitefield, that I
may hunger and thirst after righteousness.'" Passing
on, he preached at Leicester, Brookfield, and Cold-Spring,
on his way to Hadley, where he arrived on
Friday, and preached about noon. In this place he
says, "A great work was begun, and carried on some
years ago; but lately the people of God have complained
of deadness and losing their first love. However,
as soon as I mentioned what God had done for their
souls formerly, it was like putting fire to timber. The
remembrance of it quickened them, and caused many
to weep sorely." On the same afternoon he crossed
the ferry to Northampton.</p>

<p>Of the great revival of religion in New England,
which commenced at Northampton about 1734, and is
the subject of President Edwards' "Narrative," we
have already briefly spoken; its importance will justify
a more extended notice. It began without any extraordinary
circumstances to awaken the attention of the
people, or any uncommon arrangements or efforts by
the minister. The young people of the place had for
two or three years shown an increased measure of
thoughtfulness, and a growing disposition to receive
religious instruction. There had been, from time to
time, instances of strong religious impression and of
hopeful conversion. But in the latter end of December,
1734, five or six persons, one after another, became
very suddenly the subjects of the grace of God
which newly creates the soul. Among these was a
young woman distinguished for her gayety in youthful
society, "one of the greatest company-keepers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
whole town," who came to the pastor with a broken
heart and a contrite spirit, and with faith and hope in
the Saviour of sinners, before any one had heard of
her being at all impressed with serious things. The
sudden, though, as time proved, the <em>real</em> conversion of
this young woman, was the power of God striking the
electric chain of religious sympathies which had imperceptibly,
but effectually encircled all the families
of Northampton. Mr. Edwards' "Narrative" says,
"The news of it seemed to be almost like a flash of
lightning upon the hearts of young people all over the
town, and upon many others.... Presently a great
and earnest concern about the great things of religion
and the eternal world became universal in all parts
of the town, and among persons of all degrees and all
ages. All talk but about spiritual and eternal things
was soon thrown by; all the conversation in all companies
was upon these things only, except so much as
was necessary for people carrying on their ordinary
secular business. The minds of people were wonderfully
taken off from the world; it was treated among
us as a thing of very little consequence. All would
eagerly lay hold of opportunities for their souls, and
were wont very often to meet together in private
houses for religious purposes. And such meetings,
when appointed, were generally thronged. Those
who were wont to be the vainest and loosest, and
those who had been most disposed to think and speak
lightly of vital and experimental religion, were now
generally subject to great awakening. And the work
of conversion was carried on in a most astonishing
manner, and increased more and more. From day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
day, for many months together, might be seen evident
instances of sinners brought out of darkness into marvellous
light. In the spring and summer following,
the town seemed to be full of the presence of God; it
was never so full of love, and yet so full of distress,
as it was then. It was a time of joy in families, on
account of salvation being brought to them; parents
rejoicing over their children as new-born, and husbands
over their wives, and wives over their husbands.
The goings of God were then seen in his
sanctuary, God's day was a delight, and his tabernacles
were amiable. Our public assemblies were then
beautiful; the congregation was alive in God's service,
every one eagerly intent on the public worship,
every hearer eager to drink in the words of the minister
as they came from his mouth. The assembly
were, from time to time, in tears, while the word was
preached; some weeping with sorrow and distress,
others with joy and love, others with pity and concern
for their neighbors."</p>

<p>In December, 1743, nine years after this blessed
work had begun, Edwards writes, "Ever since the
great work of God that was wrought here about nine
years ago, there has been a great, abiding alteration
in this town, in many respects. There has been vastly
more religion kept up in the town, among all sorts of
persons, in religious exercises, and in common conversation,
than used to be before. There has remained
a more general seriousness and decency in attending
the public worship. I suppose the town has been in
no measure so free from vice, for any long time together,
for these sixty years, as it has these nine years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
past. There has also been an evident alteration with
respect to a charitable spirit to the poor. And though,
after that great work of nine years ago, there has
been a very lamentable decay of religious affections,
and the engagedness of people's spirits in religion,
yet many societies for prayer and social religion were
all along kept up, and there were some few instances
of awakening and deep concern about the things of
another world, even in the most dead time. In the
year 1740, in the spring, before Mr. Whitefield came
to this town, there was a visible alteration. There
was more seriousness and religious conversation, especially
among young people. Those things that were
of ill tendency among them were more forborne; and
it was a more frequent thing for persons to visit their
ministers upon soul accounts. In some particular persons,
there appeared a great alteration about that
time. And thus it continued till Mr. Whitefield came
to town, which was about the middle of October
following."</p>

<p>And what thought Whitefield himself on his arrival
at Northampton? Let us hear him. "Their pastor's
name is Edwards, successor and grandson to the
great Stoddard, whose memory will be always precious
to my soul, and whose books, entitled, "<cite>A Guide
to Christ</cite>," and "<cite>Safety of appearing in Christ's righteousness</cite>,"
I would recommend to all. Mr. Edwards
is a solid, excellent Christian, but at present weak in
body. I think I may say I have not seen his fellow
in all New England. When I came into his pulpit, I
found my heart drawn out to talk of scarce any thing
besides the consolations and privileges of saints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the plentiful effusion of the Spirit upon the hearts of
believers. And when I came to remind them of their
former experiences, and how zealous and lively they
were at that time, both minister and people wept
much; and the Holy Ghost enabled me to speak with
a great deal of power. In the evening, I gave a word
of exhortation to several who came to Mr. Edwards'
house."</p>

<p>On the following morning, "At Mr. Edwards' request,
I spoke to his little children, who were much
affected. Preached at Hatfield, five miles from Northampton,
but found myself not much strengthened.
Conversed profitably on the way about the things of
God with dear Mr. Edwards, and preached about four
in the afternoon to his congregation. I began with
fear and trembling, feeling but little power in the
morning, but God assisted me. Few dry eyes seemed
to be in the assembly for a considerable time. I had
an affecting prospect in my own heart of the glories
of the upper world, and was enabled to speak of them
feelingly to others. I believe many were filled, as it
were, with new wine; and it seemed as if a time of
refreshing was come from the presence of the Lord."</p>

<p>The day following this was the Sabbath. Whitefield
tells us in his journal, that he "felt wonderful
satisfaction in being at the house of Mr. Edwards.
He is a son himself, and hath also a daughter of Abraham
for his wife. A sweeter couple I have not yet
seen. Their children were dressed, not in silks and
satins, but plain, as becomes the children of those who
in all things ought to be examples of Christian simplicity.
She is a woman adorned with a meek and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
quiet spirit, talked feelingly and solidly of the things
of God, and seemed to be such a help-mate for her
husband, that she caused me to renew those prayers,
which, for some months, I have put up to God, that
he would be pleased to send me a daughter of Abraham
to be my wife. I find, upon many accounts, it is
my duty to marry. Lord, I desire to have no choice
of my own. Thou knowest my circumstances; thou
knowest I only desire to marry in and for thee."</p>

<p>Whitefield "preached this morning, and perceived
the melting begin sooner and rise higher than before.
Dear Mr. Edwards wept during the whole time of
exercise. The people were equally, if not more affected;
and my own soul was much lifted up towards
God. In the afternoon the power increased yet more
and more. Our Lord seemed to keep the good wine
till the last. I have not seen four such gracious meetings
together since my arrival. My soul was much
knit to these dear people of God; and though I had
not time to converse with them about their experiences,
yet one might see they were for the most
part, a gracious, tender people; and though their
former fire might be greatly abated, yet it immediately
appeared when stirred up."</p>

<p>Edwards had looked forward to Whitefield's visit
to Northampton with interest, for he felt greatly concerned
for his success. He wrote a week before his
arrival to his friend Dr. Wheelock, then a young minister
of twenty-nine, "I think that those that make
mention of the Lord, should now be awakened and
encouraged to call upon God, and not keep silence,
nor give him any rest, till he establish and till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
make Jerusalem a praise in the earth; and particularly
should be earnest with God, that he would still
uphold and succeed the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, the instrument
that it has pleased him to improve to do
such great things for the honor of his name, and at
all times so to guide and direct him under his extraordinary
circumstances, that Satan may not get any
advantage of him."</p>

<p>After his visit, Edwards writes, "Mr. Whitefield's
sermons were suitable to the circumstances of the
town; containing just reproofs of our backslidings,
and in a most moving and affecting manner, making
use of our great profession and our great mercies as
arguments with us to return to God, from whom we
had departed. Immediately after this, the minds of
the people in general appeared more engaged in religion,
showing a greater forwardness to make it the
subject of their conversation, and to meet frequently
for religious purposes, and to embrace all opportunities
to hear the word preached. The revival at first
appeared chiefly among professors, and those who had
entertained the hope that they were in a state of grace,
to whom Mr. Whitefield chiefly addressed himself;
but in a very short time, there appeared an awakening
and deep concern among some young persons that
looked upon themselves in a Christless state; and
there were some hopeful appearances of conversion;
and some professors were greatly revived. In about
a month or six weeks, there was a great alteration in
the town, both as to the revivals of professors, and
awakenings of others."</p>

<p>During this visit of Whitefield to Edwards, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
conversation was held between them, of which, several
years afterwards, as it appears to us, far too much
was said. Edwards took an opportunity, privately,
to converse with his friend about <em>impulses</em>, and furnished
him with some reasons for thinking that he gave
too much attention to such things. Whitefield did
not appear offended, neither did he seem inclined to
converse much on the subject, or to yield to the reasonings
of his friend Edwards. The latter says, "It
is true, that I thought Mr. Whitefield liked me not so
well for my opposing these things; and though he
treated me with great kindness, yet he never made so
much of an intimate of me, as of some others." It
seems also, that they conversed on the strong language
which the great evangelist was accustomed to
employ as to those whom he considered to be unconverted,
and the duty of the people to forsake the
preaching of ministers whom he did not consider to
be renewed in the spirit of their minds. Whitefield
told Edwards also, of the design he had cherished of
bringing over a number of young men from England,
to be ordained by the Tennents, in New Jersey; an
object, however, which he never accomplished.</p>

<p>It appears that after preaching at Northampton
twice on the Sabbath, Whitefield, accompanied by his
friend Edwards, rode to the house of the father of the
last-named gentleman, the Rev. Timothy Edwards, in
East Windsor, Connecticut. At this place, as also at
Westfield, Springfield, Suffield, Hartford, Wethersfield,
Middletown, and Wallingford, he preached to
large assemblies, generally with his accustomed animation
and power, and with the happy proofs of success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
which he so frequently witnessed. During this
week also, he experienced a remarkable deliverance
from great danger. He says, "A little after I left
Springfield, my horse, coming over a broken bridge,
threw me over his head, directly upon my nose. The
fall stunned me for a while. My mouth was full of
dust, I bled a little, but falling upon soft sand, got not
much damage. After I had recovered myself, and
mounted my horse, God so filled me with a sense of
his sovereign, distinguishing love, and my own unworthiness,
that my eyes gushed out with tears; but
they were all tears of love. Oh, how did I want to
sink before the high and lofty One who inhabiteth
eternity!"</p>

<p>During this week also, on his way to Suffield, he
met with a minister who said, "It was not absolutely
necessary for a gospel minister, that he should be converted;"
meaning, no doubt, that though conversion
was necessary to his salvation, it was not indispensable
to his ministerial character and usefulness. This
gave Whitefield a subject. "I insisted much in my
discourse upon the doctrine of the new birth, and also
the necessity of a minister's being converted, before
he could preach Christ aright. The word came with
great power, and a great impression was made upon
the people in all parts of the assembly. Many ministers
were present. I did not spare them. Most of
them thanked me for my plain dealing; but one was
offended; and so would more of his stamp be, if I
were to continue longer in New England. For unconverted
ministers are the bane of the Christian
church; and though I honor the memory of that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and good man Mr. Stoddard, yet I think he is much
to be blamed for endeavoring to prove that unconverted
men might be admitted into the ministry. How
he has handled the controversy, I know not. I think
no solid arguments can be brought to defend such a
cause. A sermon lately published by Mr. Gilbert
Tennent, entitled, '<cite>The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry</cite>,'
I think unanswerable. Tracy truly says, that
Stoddard, in his '<cite>Appeal to the Learned</cite>,' assumes that
an unconverted minister is bound to continue in the
performance of ministerial duties, and infers that unconverted
men may therefore be admitted to the church.
This opinion at one period extensively prevailed,
though all held it desirable that a minister should be
a converted man. By his attacks on this opinion, and
especially by thus endorsing Tennent's Nottingham
sermon, Whitefield gave great offence."</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, he preached at East
Windsor, and spent the night with Mr. Edwards, senior,
"I believe," he says, "a true disciple and minister
of the Lord Jesus Christ. After exercise, we supped
at the house of old Mr. Edwards. His wife was
as aged, I believe, as himself, and I fancied that I was
sitting in the house of a Zacharias and Elisabeth." On
the following day, he "preached to many thousands,
and with much freedom and power," at Hartford in
the morning, and at Wethersfield in the afternoon.
Here he met Messrs. Wheelock and Pomeroy, "two
young, faithful, and zealous ministers of Jesus Christ."
From this place he had intended to go eastward as
far as Plymouth, and return by another route to Providence,
and notice had been given in the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of about twenty sermons which he proposed to preach
at the times and places specified. He was afterwards
blamed for making these appointments without first
consulting the pastors of the several churches; thus
giving countenance, it was said, to the practice of itinerants
intruding into other men's parishes without
their consent. The proceeding was certainly somewhat
irregular, but Whitefield was not much to be
blamed for it. The details were settled, and the publication
made, by men in whose judgment and knowledge
of the customs of the country he had a right to
confide; and the appointments were believed, in all
cases, and doubtless known in some, to be agreeable
to the parties concerned. At Wethersfield, however,
the evangelist ascertained the necessity of his hastening
on to New York, and immediately, therefore, published
a note recalling these appointments.</p>

<p>On Friday, October 24, Whitefield arrived at New
Haven, and was entertained at the house of Mr. James
Pierpont, the brother-in-law of Mr. Edwards, and of
Mr. Noyes, the minister of the First Congregational
church. The Legislature of the colony being in session,
he remained till after the Lord's day; and "had
the pleasure of seeing numbers daily impressed," under
his ministrations in the old polygonal meeting-house.
Several ministers of the vicinity visited him,
"with whose pious conversation he was much refreshed."
Good old Governor Tallcott, on whom with
due politeness he waited to pay his respects, said to
him, "Thanks be to God for such refreshings in our
way to heaven." Among others who heard his glowing
appeals to the congregations that listened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him during this visit, was young Samuel Hopkins,
still well known as an eminent divine. Hopkins was
now nineteen, and was a student at college; his biographer
tells us, that "he was much interested in the
man, and much impressed by his solemn warnings."</p>

<p>The testimony of Hopkins himself may here be
introduced. He says, speaking of Whitefield, "The
attention of the people in general was greatly awakened
upon hearing the fame of him, that there was a
remarkable preacher from England travelling through
the country. The people flocked to hear him when
he came to New Haven. Some travelled twenty miles
out of the country to hear him. The assemblies were
crowded, and remarkably attentive; people appeared
generally to approve, and their conversation turned
chiefly upon him and his preaching. Some disapproved
of several things, which occasioned considerable
disputes. I heard him when he preached in
public, and when he expounded in private in the
evening, and highly approved of him, and was impressed
by what he said in public and in private. He
preached against mixed dancing and the frolicking
of males and females together, which practice was
then very common in New England. This offended
some, especially young people. But I remember I
justified him in this in my own mind, and in conversation
with those who were disposed to condemn him.
This was in October, 1740, when I had entered on
my last year in college."</p>

<p>On this visit, Whitefield dined with the Rev. Mr.
Clap, the rector of the college. Of the college he
says, "It is about one-third part as big as Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
It has one rector, three tutors, and about a
hundred students. But I hear of no remarkable concern
among them concerning religion." Mr. Clap, it
is well known, afterwards became the public opponent
of Whitefield; and it would seem that his dislike to
him commenced with this first interview; for he
"spoke very closely to the students, and showed the
dreadful consequences of an unconverted ministry."
In his journal of the day he says, "O that God may
quicken ministers! O that the Lord may make them a
flaming fire!" On the two days following, he preached
at Milford, Stratford, and Fairfield, on his way to New
York. On Wednesday, when at Stamford, he thus
speaks of New England and his labors in it:</p>

<p>"I give God thanks for sending me to New England.
I have now had an opportunity of seeing the
greatest and most populous parts of it; and take it
all together, it certainly on many accounts exceeds
all other provinces of America, and for the establishment
of religion, perhaps all other parts of the world.
Never, surely, was so large a spot of ground settled
in such a manner, in so short a space of one hundred
years. The towns all through Connecticut and eastwards
towards York in the province of Massachusetts,
[Maine,] near the river-side, are large, well peopled,
and exceedingly pleasant to travel through. Every
five miles, or perhaps less, you have a meeting-house,
and I believe there is no such a thing as a pluralist,
or non-resident minister in both provinces. Many,
nay, most that preach, I fear do not experimentally
know Christ; yet I cannot see much worldly advantage
to tempt them to take upon them the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
function. Few country ministers, as I have been informed,
have sufficient allowed them in money to
maintain a family. God has remarkably, in sundry
times and in divers manners, poured out his Spirit in
several parts of both provinces; and it often refreshes
my soul to hear of the faith of the good forefathers
who first settled in these parts. Notwithstanding
they had their foibles, surely they were a set of righteous
men. They certainly followed our Lord's rule,
sought first the kingdom of God and his righteousness;
and behold, all other things God added unto
them. Their seed are now blessed, in temporal things
especially, and notwithstanding the rising generation
seem to be settled on their lees, yet I believe the Lord
hath more than seven thousand who have not bowed
the knee to Baal. The ministers and people of Connecticut
seem to be more simple than those that live
near Boston, especially in those parts where I went.
But I think the ministers' preaching almost universally
by notes, is a certain mark they have in a great measure
lost the old spirit of preaching. For though all
are not to be condemned that use notes, yet it is a sad
symptom of the decay of vital religion when reading
sermons becomes fashionable, where extempore preaching
did once almost universally prevail. As for the
universities, I believe it may be said, their light is
become darkness, darkness that may be felt, and is
complained of by the most godly ministers. I pray
God these fountains may be purified, and send forth
pure streams to water the cities of our God.... As for
the civil government of New England, it seems to be
well regulated, and I think, at opening all their courts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
either the judge or a minister begins with a prayer.
Family worship, I believe, is generally kept up. The
negroes I think better used, both in soul and body,
than in any other province I have yet seen. In short,
I like New England exceedingly well; and when a
spirit of reformation revives, it certainly will prevail
here more than in other places, because they are simple
in their worship, less corrupt in their principles,
and consequently easier to be brought over to the
form of sound words, into which so many of their
pious ancestors were delivered. Send forth, O Lord,
thy light and thy truth, and for thine infinite mercy's
sake, show thou hast a peculiar delight in these habitable
parts of the earth. Amen, Lord Jesus, amen,
and amen."</p>

<p>Among many who became the subjects of divine
grace during this visit of Whitefield to New England,
was Daniel Emerson, who was educated at Harvard
college, where he received his first degree in 1739,
and where he continued to reside for some time as a
graduate. While at college, he is said to have been
very fond of the gay pleasures of this life, until his
attention was effectually called to religion by the
preaching of Whitefield, whom he followed from place
to place for several days. He was ordained at Hollis,
New Hampshire, in 1743, where, in a ministry of fifty
years, he was a worthy follower of his spiritual father.
The chief excellences of his preaching were sound doctrine,
deep feeling, and zeal at times almost overwhelming.
He was truly a son of thunder, and a
flaming light. He was almost incessantly engaged in
labors, preaching, attending funerals, etc., far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
near. His efforts were greatly blessed, especially
among his own people, who under his ministry enjoyed
extensive revivals of religion, and where also a
large number of ministers have been called to their
work. He died in 1801, aged eighty-five.</p>

<p>It may be appropriate to introduce here a sketch
of Whitefield's doctrines and labors at this time, as
given us by the eminent Dr. Thomas Prince, in his
"Christian History," under date of January 26, 1744-5,
but having reference to Whitefield's first visit to New
England, which we have just described:</p>

<p>"He spoke with a mighty sense of God, eternity,
the immortality and preciousness of the souls of his
hearers, of their original corruption, and of the extreme
danger the unregenerate are in; with the nature
and absolute necessity of regeneration by the Holy
Ghost; and of believing in Christ, in order to our
pardon, justification, yielding an acceptable obedience,
and obtaining salvation from hell and an entrance
into heaven. His doctrine was plainly that of the
reformers; declaring against our putting our good
works or morality in the room of Christ's righteousness,
or their having any hand in our justification, or
being indeed pleasing to God while we are totally
unsanctified, acting upon corrupt principles, and unreconciled
enemies to him; which occasioned some to
mistake him, as if he opposed morality. But he insisted
on it, that the tree of the heart is by original
sin exceedingly corrupted, and must be made good by
regeneration, that so the fruits proceeding from it may
be good likewise; that where the heart is renewed, it
ought and will be careful to maintain good works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that if any be not habitually so careful who think
themselves renewed, they deceive their own souls;
and even the most improved in holiness, as well as
others, must entirely depend on the righteousness of
Christ for the acceptance of their persons and services.
And though now and then he dropped some expressions
that were not so accurate and guarded as we
should expect from aged and long-studied ministers,
yet I had the satisfaction to observe his readiness with
great modesty and thankfulness to receive correction
as soon as offered.</p>

<p>"In short, he was a most importunate wooer of
souls to come to Christ for the enjoyment of him, and
all his benefits. He distinctly applied his exhortations
to the elderly people, the middle-aged, the young,
the Indians, and negroes, and had a most winning
way of addressing them. He affectionately prayed
for our magistrates, ministers, colleges, candidates for
the ministry, and churches, as well as people in general;
and before he left us, in a public and moving
manner, he observed to the people how sorry he was
to hear that the religious assemblies, especially on
lectures, had been so thin, exhorted them earnestly to
a more general attendance on our public ministrations
for the time to come, and told them how glad he
should be to hear of the same.</p>

<p>"Multitudes were greatly affected, and many awakened
with his lively ministry. Though he preached
every day, the houses were crowded; but when he
preached on the Common, a vaster number attended;
and almost every evening the house where he lodged
was thronged to hear his prayers and counsels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"On Mr. Whitefield's leaving us, great numbers in
this town [Boston] were so happily concerned about
their souls, as we had never seen any thing like it before,
except at the time of the general earthquake;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and their desires excited to hear their ministers more
than ever. So that our assemblies, both on lectures
and Sabbaths, were surprisingly increased, and now
the people wanted to hear us oftener. In consequence
of which a public lecture was proposed to be
set up at Dr. Colman's church, near the midst of the
town, on every Tuesday evening."</p>

<p>In reference to the work of grace which was connected
with Whitefield's preaching in New England,
the Rev. Dr. Baron Stow, in his "Centennial Discourse,"
says, "The result, by the blessing of God, was
a powerful revival, such as New England had never
witnessed. The work was opposed with great vehemence;
and no impartial reader of the history of those
extraordinary scenes can question that much of the
hostility was provoked by improprieties of both speech
and action, that would at any time be offensive to
those who love good order and Christian decorum.
But after making liberal allowance for all that was
truly exceptionable, it is cheerfully admitted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
candid Christian, that the excitement was, in the
main, the product of the Holy Spirit, and that its
fruits were eminently favorable to the advancement
of true religion. A torpid community was aroused,
as by the trump of God, from its long and heavy slumber;
ministers and people were converted; the style
of preaching, and the tone of individual piety were
improved; a cold, cadaverous formalism gave place
to the living energy of experimental godliness; the
doctrines of the gospel were brought out from their
concealment, and made to reassert their claims to a
cordial, practical credence, and all the interests of
truth and holiness received new homage from regenerated
thousands."</p>

<p>One or two other facts connected with Whitefield's
usefulness in New England are too important to be
omitted. During this visit he was much gratified by
an interview with a colored man, who had been his
chaise-driver when he first visited Cambridge. The
negro had heard him preach in the college a sermon
especially addressed "to those who labor and are
heavy-laden." It took such a hold on the poor man,
that he repeated it in the kitchen when he reached
home. Mr. Cooper of Boston was so well satisfied,
as was Whitefield also, with his account of his conversion,
that he was admitted to the Lord's table.</p>

<p>Another "brand plucked from the burning" was a
son of Mackintosh, an English rebel, who had been
condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and had been
allowed by George the First to settle in New England.
One of his daughters, a lady of fortune, had
heard Whitefield preach in Dr. Prince's church at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Boston, and had been won by the word to Christ.
She was soon after smitten by sickness, and ripened
rapidly for heaven. On her death-bed she cried out
for her "soul friend" Mr. Whitefield; but checking
her own impatience, she asked, "Why should I do so?
He is gone about his Master's work, and in a little
time we shall meet to part no more." The distinguished
evangelist had a very high opinion of her
piety, and his interest in her was increased by the
fact that she had a very remarkable escape from some
ruffians who had been bribed to convey her and her
sister to Scotland, that their uncle might seize on an
estate worth a thousand pounds a year.</p>

<p>There were at this time not less than twenty ministers
in the neighborhood of Boston who unhesitatingly
spoke of Whitefield as their spiritual father,
directly tracing their conversion to his ministry. Of
one of these we have an account by Collins, the journalist
of South Reading. Speaking of 1741, he says,
"Mr. Whitefield preached upon our Common in the
open air. Mr. Hobby the minister went with the multitude
to hear him. It is said that Mr. Hobby afterwards
remarked, he came to pick a hole in Mr. Whitefield's
coat, but that Whitefield picked a hole in his
heart. Mr. Hobby afterwards wrote and published
a defence of Mr. Whitefield in a letter to Mr. Henchman,
the minister of Lynn, who had written against
him."</p>

<p>The letters of Whitefield, during his journeys of
eleven hundred miles in New England, were few and
brief; but they clearly indicated that at this time he
was inclined "to return no more to his native country."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
New England, notwithstanding his trials there,
had evidently won his heart, and for a time almost
weaned him from Great Britain. When he left it, as
he was now about to do, for the south, he wrote,
"God only knows what a cross it was to me to leave
dear New England so soon. I hope death will not
be so bitter to me as was parting with my friends.
Glad shall I be to be <em>prayed</em> thither again before I see
my native land. I would just be where He would
have me, although in the uttermost parts of the earth.
I am now hunting for poor lost sinners in these <em>ungospelized</em>
wilds."</p>

<p>Is there not an awfully retributive providence connected
with the rejection of the gospel and its ministers?
Do we not see this principle at work in the
history and present state of the Jews; and has it not
often appeared also in the history of Christianity?
There was a beautiful village, now a city, in Massachusetts,
from which Whitefield was driven with such
rancorous abuse, that he shook off the dust of his feet,
and proclaimed that the Spirit of God would not
visit that spot till the last of those persecutors was
dead. The good man's language had a fearful truth
in it, though he was not divinely gifted with the
prophet's inspiration. A consciousness of desertion
paralyzed the energies of the church; for nearly a
century it was nurtured on the unwholesome food of
unscriptural doctrine. In the very garden of natural
loveliness, it sat like a heath in the desert, upon
which there could be no rain; and not till that whole
generation had passed from the earth, did Zion appear
there in her beauty and strength.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>LABORS IN NEW YORK AND THE MIDDLE AND
SOUTHERN STATES.<br />

1740, 1741.</h3>


<p>Whitefield was now again on his way to New
York, preaching at Rye and King's Bridge on the
road. At the latter place he was met by several
friends from the city, with whom he pleasantly talked,
"and found," he says, "an inexpressible satisfaction in
my soul when I arrived at the house of my very dear
friend Mr. Noble. After supper the Lord filled my
heart, and gave me to wrestle with him for New York
inhabitants and my own dear friends." He was also
cheered by meeting Mr. Davenport from Long Island,
whose labors as an evangelist were then exciting much
interest. Here too he met with a violent pamphlet
published against him. "Met also with two volumes
of sermons published in London as delivered by me,
though I never preached on most of the texts. But
Satan must try all ways to bring the work of God
into contempt."</p>

<p>On the morning after his arrival, Whitefield
preached in Mr. Pemberton's meeting-house, and says
concerning the service, "Never saw the word of God
fall with such weight in New York before. Two or
three cried out. Mr. Noble could scarce refrain himself.
And look where I would, many seemed deeply
wounded. At night the word was attended with
great power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
me at the latter end of my sermon to speak with
authority. Alas, how vain are the thoughts of men!
As I came along yesterday, I found my heart somewhat
dejected, and told Mr. Noble I expected but
little moving in New York; but he bid me 'expect
great things from God,' and likewise told me of several
who were, as he hoped, savingly wrought upon
by my ministry when I was there last."</p>

<p>On the following day he finished his answer to
the pamphlet already referred to, and says, "God
enabled me to write it in the spirit of meekness."
He adds, "Preached twice as yesterday to very crowded
auditories, and neither time without power. In
the evening exercise some fainted, and the Lord
seemed to show us more and more that a time for
favoring New York was near at hand. Oh, wherefore
did I doubt? Lord, increase my faith."</p>

<p>The following day, November 2, was the Sabbath.
"Preached this morning with freedom and some
power, but was much dejected before the evening sermon.
For near half an hour before I left Mr. Noble's
house, I could only lie before the Lord, and say I was
a poor sinner, and wonder that Christ would be gracious
to such a wretch. As I went to meeting I grew
weaker and weaker, and when I came into the pulpit
I could have chosen to be silent rather than speak.
But after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me
freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty
rushing wind, and carried all before it. Immediately
the whole congregation was alarmed. Shrieking,
crying, weeping, and wailing were to be heard in
every corner; men's hearts failing them for fear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
many falling into the arms of their friends. My soul
was carried out till I could scarcely speak any more.
A sense of God's goodness overwhelmed me."</p>

<p>After narrating two or three pleasing incidents as
to the effect of his preaching even on the minds of
children, and describing his feelings on his return
home, he gives an account of the wedding of two
young persons who were going as his assistants to
Georgia. "Never," he says, "did I see a more solemn
wedding. Jesus Christ was called, and he was present
in a remarkable manner. After Mr. Pemberton
had married them, I prayed. But my soul, how was
it enabled to wrestle with and lay hold on God! I
was in a very great agony, and the Holy Ghost was
so remarkably present, that most, I believe, could say,
'Surely God is in this place.' After this, divine manifestations
flowed in so fast, that my frail tabernacle
was scarce able to sustain them. My dear friends sat
round me on the bedsides. I prayed for each of them
alternately with strong cries, and pierced by the eye
of faith even within the veil. I continued in this condition
for about half an hour, astonished at my own
vileness and the excellency of Christ, then rose full of
peace and love and joy."</p>

<p>On Monday, the 3d, he preached both morning
and afternoon to increasing congregations, and says,
"There was a great and gracious melting both times,
but no crying out. Nearly &#163;110 currency were collected
for the orphans; and in the evening many came
and took an affectionate leave. About seven we took
boat; reached Staten Island about ten, greatly refreshed
in my inner man. A dear Christian friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
received us gladly, and we solaced ourselves by singing
and praying. About midnight retired to sleep,
still longing for that time when I shall sleep no
more."</p>

<p>On Tuesday he preached on Staten Island from a
wagon, to three or four hundred people. "The Lord
came among them," and several inquired after the
way of salvation. Here he met Gilbert Tennent and
Mr. Cross. The former of these excellent ministers
had recently lost his wife, and though he was ardently
attached to her, he calmly preached her funeral sermon
with the corpse lying before him. Tennent had
lately been preaching in New Jersey and Maryland,
and had a delightful account to give his friend of the
progress of the good work. Nor was the account
given by Mr. Cross of less interest. After sermon he
rode to Newark, where he preached till dark, as he
thought with but little good effect. "However, at
night the Lord manifested forth his glory; for, coming
down to family prayer where I lodged, and perceiving
many young men around me, my soul was, as
it were, melted down with concern for them. After
singing, I gave a word of exhortation; with what
power none can fully express but those that saw it.
Oh, how did the word fall like a hammer and like a
fire. What a weeping was there!"</p>

<p>We must stay a moment to give a fact or two
in reference to the Rev. Aaron Burr, then quite a
young man, who two or three years before had been
ordained at Newark, and whose ministry had been
attended with a delightful revival the year preceding
Whitefield's visit. During the period of this revival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the neighboring village of Elizabethtown had
been remarkable for its insensibility; even Whitefield
had preached there, "and not a single known conversion,"
says Dr. Stearns, "followed his ministrations."
Afterwards the pastor, the well-known Jonathan Dickinson,
saw happy results from very plain preaching.
Newark caught a new flame from its neighboring altar,
and Mr. Burr, who had lately been to New England
in quest of health, had heard the devoted evangelist
again and again, and invited him to visit his flock,
which he did about a month afterwards with happy
results. The account given by Mr. Burr of Whitefield's
preaching in New England was precisely what
we should expect from the man who was afterwards
the first president of Princeton college, and who, fourteen
years after this, accompanied his eloquent friend
to New England, "and saw at Boston, morning after
morning, three or four thousand people hanging in
breathless silence on the lips of the preacher, and
weeping silent tears."</p>

<p>The Rev. Stephen Dodd of East Haven, Conn.,
relates that an old lady told him that when Mr.
Whitefield came to preach in the old meeting-house at
Newark, she was twelve years old, and as he entered
the pulpit she looked at him with distrust, but before
he got through his prayers herself and all the congregation
were melted down, and the sermon filled the
house with groans and tears. The next time he came,
the congregation was so large that the pulpit window
was taken out, and he preached through the opening
to the people in the burying-ground.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 5th, he went to Baskinridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Mr. Cross' parish, where he found Mr. Davenport,
who, according to appointment, had been preaching to
about three thousand people. He writes, "As I went
along, I told a friend my soul wept for them, and I
was persuaded within myself that the Lord would
that day make his power to be known among them.
In prayer, I perceived my soul drawn out, and a
stirring of affections among the people. I had not
discoursed long before the Holy Ghost displayed his
power. In every part of the congregation somebody
or other began to cry out, and almost all melted into
tears. This abated for a few moments, till a little
boy about seven or eight years of age cried out exceeding
piteously indeed, and wept as though his little
heart would break. Mr. Cross having compassion on
him, took him up into the wagon, which so affected
me, that I broke from my discourse, and told the people
the little boy should preach to them, and that God,
since old professors would not cry after Christ, had
displayed his sovereignty, and out of an infant's mouth
was perfecting praise. God so blessed this, that a
universal concern fell on the congregation again.
Fresh persons dropped down here and there, and the
cry increased more and more."</p>

<p>In the evening, Gilbert Tennent preached excellently
in Mr. Cross' barn, two miles off. His subject
was the necessity and benefit of spiritual desertions, a
remarkable subject, as has been said, at such a time,
in a barn, and at night. "A great commotion," says
Whitefield, "was soon observed among the hearers.
I then gave a word of exhortation. The Lord's presence
attended it in a surprising manner. One, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
about six minutes, cried out, 'He is come, He is come!'
and could scarcely sustain the discovery that Jesus
Christ made of himself to his soul. Others were so
earnest for a discovery of the Lord to their souls, that
their eager crying obliged me to stop, and I prayed
over them as I saw their agonies and distress increase.
At length my own soul was so full that I retired, and
was in a strong agony for some time, and wept before
the Lord under a deep sense of my own vileness, and
the sovereignty and greatness of God's everlasting
love. Most of the people spent the remainder of the
night in prayer and praise. Two or three young ministers
spoke alternately, and others prayed as the Lord
gave them utterance."</p>

<p>The next morning Whitefield exhorted, sung, and
prayed with the people in the barn, and had some delightful
conversation with a lad of thirteen, a poor
negro woman, and several others. In company with
several Christian friends, he then rode to the house of
Gilbert Tennent in New Brunswick. Here he found
letters from Savannah saying that great mortality existed
in the neighborhood, but that the family at the
orphan-house continued in health, and that a minister
was about coming from England to take his church at
Savannah. "This last," says he, "much rejoiced me,
being resolved to give up the Savannah living as soon
as I arrived in Georgia. A parish and the orphan-house
together are too much for me; besides, God seems
to show me it is my duty to evangelize, and not to fix
in any particular place." Here he was met by William
Tennent also, and after much conversation and prayer,
it was settled that Gilbert Tennent should go to Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to carry on the work so happily begun there.
After preaching, exhortation, and prayer, Whitefield
went with Davenport to Trenton, and so on to Philadelphia.
On their way, they were twice remarkably
preserved from drowning in creeks much swollen by
the rains; and late on a very dark Saturday night
arrived in the city, which had been already honored
by his usefulness.</p>

<p>On the following day, he twice preached in the
house which his friends were now building for him,
and in which Gilbert Tennent labored for many years
with great success. He says, "It is one hundred feet
long and seventy feet broad. A large gallery is to
be erected all around in it. Many footsteps of Providence
have been visible in beginning and carrying it on.
Both in the morning and evening God's glory filled
the house, for there was great power in the congregation.
The roof is not yet up, but the people raised a
convenient pulpit and boarded the bottom. The joy
of most of the hearers when they saw me was inexpressible.
Between services, I received a packet of
letters from England, dated in March last. May the
Lord heal, and bring good out of the divisions which
at present seem to be among the brethren there. God
giving me freedom, and many friends being in the
room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted
them all. But Oh, how did they melt under both; my
soul was much rejoiced to look round on them."</p>

<p>A fact in connection with the building of this
church edifice illustrates the practical philosophy of
Dr. Franklin. Tennent waited on him for aid in the
erection of the house, which was cheerfully afforded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the philosopher was asked by Tennent as to the best
method of raising the necessary funds, who instantly
recommended him to call at every house in the town
to solicit help. He argued thus: "Many are really
desirous to give, and will be glad to see you; others
are inclined to be friendly, and will give if they are
urged; a third will be sure, if they are omitted, to
say they would have given had they been asked;
and a fourth class will give you, rather than have
it said they refused." Tennent acted on the doctor's
counsel, and the funds were raised without difficulty.</p>

<p>Two instances of the happy influence of the truth
in the conversion of sinners, in connection with this
visit, must be given from Whitefield's own pen. The
first related to a Mr. Brockden, a lawyer eminent in
his profession, and the recorder of deeds for the city.
For many years this gentleman had been distinguished
for Deism. Whitefield writes, "In his younger days
he had some religious impressions, but going into
business, the cares of the world so choked the good
seed, that he not only forgot his God in some degree,
but at length began to doubt of and to dispute his
very being. In this state he continued many years,
and has been very zealous to propagate his deistical,
I could almost say atheistical principles among moral
men; but he told me he never endeavored to make
proselytes of vicious, debauched people. When I
came to Philadelphia, this time twelvemonth, he told
me he had not so much as a curiosity to hear me.
But a brother Deist, his choicest friend, pressed him
to come and hear me. To satisfy his curiosity, he at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
length complied with the request. I preached at the
court-house stairs, upon the conference which the Lord
had with Nicodemus. I had not spoken much before
the Lord struck his heart. 'For,' said he, 'I saw your
doctrine tended to make people good.' His family
knew not that he had been to hear me. After he
came home, his wife, who had been at sermon, came
in also, and wished heartily that he had heard me.
He said nothing. After this, another of his family
came in, repeating the same wish; and, if I mistake
not, after that another; till at last, being unable to
refrain any longer, with tears in his eyes, he said,
'Why, I have been hearing him;' and then expressed
his approbation. Ever since he has followed on to
know the Lord; and I verily believe Jesus Christ
has made himself manifest to his soul. Though upwards
of threescore years old, he is now, I believe,
born again of God. He is as a little child, and often,
as he told me, receives such communications from
God, when he retires into the woods, that he thinks
he could die a martyr for the truth."</p>

<p>The other instance was that of the captain of a
ship, "as great a reprobate," says Whitefield, "as
ever I heard of." This man used to go on board the
transport ships, and offer a guinea for a new oath,
that he might have the honor of making it. "To the
honor of God's grace," says our evangelist, "let it be
said, he is now, I believe, a Christian; not only reformed,
but renewed. The effectual stroke, he told
me, was given when I preached last spring at Pennepack.
Ever since he has been zealous for the truth;
stood like a lamb when he was beaten, and in danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of being murdered by some of my opposers, and, in
short, shows his faith by his works."</p>

<p>The stay of Mr. Whitefield in Philadelphia at this
time was about a week, during which he preached in
the new house twice every day to large and deeply
interested congregations. He says, "It would be
almost endless to recount all the particular instances
of God's grace which I have seen this week past.
Many that before were only convicted, now plainly
proved that they were converted, and had a clear evidence
of it within themselves. My chief business was
now to build up and to exhort them to continue in the
grace of God. Notwithstanding, many were convicted
almost every day, and came to me under the greatest
distress and anguish of soul. Several societies are
now in the town, not only of men and women, but of
little boys and little girls. Being so engaged, I could
not visit them as I would, but I hope the Lord will
raise up some fellow-laborers, and that elders will be
ordained in every place."</p>

<p>Perhaps no man was ever more free from sectarianism
than George Whitefield. It is true, that he
was ordained a clergyman of the church of England,
and never manifested any degree of reluctance to
officiate within its walls; but it is equally true, that
the vast majority of his sermons were delivered in
connection with other bodies of Christians. When
he was once preaching from the balcony of the court-house,
Market-street, Philadelphia, he delivered an
impressive apostrophe: "Father Abraham, who have
you in heaven? any Episcopalians?" "No." "Any
Presbyterians?" "No." "Any Baptists?" "No."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
"Have you any Methodists, Seceders, or Independents
there?" "No, no!" "Why, who have you there?"
"We don't know those names here. All who are
here are Christians, believers in Christ&mdash;men who
have overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and the
word of his testimony." "Oh, is that the case? then
God help me, God help us all, to forget party names,
and to become Christians, in deed and in truth." It
might be well for the different bodies of Christians
to think of the propriety of following this example of
the holy man. The peculiarities of each Christian
denomination may have their importance, but they
ought not to keep good men in a state of separation,
much less of alienation from each other.</p>

<p>On Monday, November 17, Whitefield left Philadelphia.
He says, "Was much melted at parting from
my dear friends. Had it much impressed upon my
mind, that I should go to England, and undergo trials
for the truth's sake. These words, 'The Jews sought
to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?' with our
Lord's answer, have been for some time lying upon
me; and while my friends were weeping round me,
St. Paul's words darted into my soul, 'What mean
you to weep and break my heart? I am willing not
only to be bound, but to die for the Lord Jesus.'
After fervent prayer, I took my leave of some, but
being to preach at Gloucester in the West Jerseys,
others accompanied me in boats over the river. We
sung as we sailed, but my heart was low. I preached
at Gloucester, but found myself weighed down, and
was not able to deliver my sermon with my usual
vigor. However, there was an affecting melting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
several, as I heard afterwards, who had been in bondage
before, at that time received joy in the Holy
Ghost. I rode on in company with several to Greenwich,
and preached to a few, with scarce any power.
In the evening we travelled on a few miles, but my
body was more and more out of order, and I thought
God was preparing me for future blessings. It is
good to be humbled. I am never better than when
I am brought to lie at the foot of the cross. It is a
certain sign God intends that soul a greater crown.
Lord, let me always feel myself a poor sinner." On
Tuesday he preached at Pilesgrove to about two thousand
people, but saw only a few affected. "At night,"
he says, "God was pleased so abundantly to refresh
my soul as to make me forget the weakness of my
body; I prayed and exhorted with great power in the
family where I lodged." On Wednesday, at Cohansey,
where Gilbert Tennent had prepared the way
for him, he says, "Preached to some thousands both
morning and afternoon. The word gradually struck
the hearers, till the whole congregation was greatly
moved, and two cried out in the bitterness of their
souls after a crucified Saviour, and were scarcely
able to stand. My soul was replenished as with new
wine, and life and power flew all around me." At
Salem, on the 20th, he preached in the morning at the
court-house, and in the afternoon in the open air before
the prison, to about two thousand persons. "Both
times God was with us." On Friday, November 21,
he got with some difficulty to Newcastle, where he
preached in the court-house, and "observed some few
affected, and some few scoffing." Here he was joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
by Mr. Charles Tennent, who had lately married a
young lady awakened under Whitefield's ministry.
They went on to White Clay creek, "and God," says
he, "was pleased to appear for me in an extraordinary
manner. There were many thousands waiting to hear
the word. I have not seen a more lovely sight. I
sang the twenty-third psalm, and these words gave my
soul unspeakable comfort:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'In presence of my spiteful foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He does my table spread.'<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"The Lord Jesus assisted me in preaching. The
melting soon began, and the power increased more
and more, till the greatest part of the congregation
was exceedingly moved. Several cried out in different
parts, and others were to be seen wringing their
hands and weeping bitterly. The stir was ten times
greater than when I was here last." At Fagg's Manor,
on Saturday afternoon, he preached "to many thousands,
and God was pleased mightily to own his word.
There was a wondrous powerful moving, but it did
not rise to such a degree as when I preached here
last spring. I was taken ill after preaching." After
still farther labors, he retired to rest, and he says,
"The Lord gave me sweet sleep, and in the morning I
arose with my natural strength much renewed." This
was the Sabbath, and he preached at Nottingham "to
a large congregation, who seemed in no wise to regard
the rain, so they might be watered with the dew
of God's blessing."</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, at Bohemia, in Maryland,
he says, "Preached to about two thousand, and
have not seen a more solid melting, I think, since my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
arrival. Some scoffers stood on the outside, but the
Holy Spirit enabled me to lay the terrors of the Lord
before them, and they grew more serious. My soul
much rejoiced in the Lord to see salvation brought to
Maryland." On Tuesday, November 25, "came to
Reedy Island, and had the wonderful presence of God
in the assembly in the afternoon. Several of my dear
Philadelphia friends came to take their last farewell."
On Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, he preached
again. "The Lord was with us every time. I was
greatly delighted to see the captains of the ships, and
their respective crews, come constantly to hear the
word of God on shore, and join with us in religious
exercises on board."</p>

<p>On December 1, when they sailed from Reedy
Island to Charleston, he wrote in his journal, "But
before I go on, stop, O my soul, and look back a little
on the great things the Lord hath done for thee during
this excursion. I think it is now the seventy-fifth
day since I arrived at Rhode Island. My body
was then weak, but the Lord has much renewed its
strength. I have been enabled to preach, I think, one
hundred and seventy-five times in public, besides exhorting
very frequently in private. I have travelled
upwards of eight hundred miles, and gotten upwards
of &#163;700 sterling in goods, provisions, and money for
my poor orphans. Never did God vouchsafe me such
great assistances. Never did I perform my journeys
with so little fatigue, or see such a continuance of the
divine presence in the congregations to whom I have
preached. All things concur to convince me that
America is to be my chief scene for action."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>In about eight days, he arrived at Charleston,
where he found there had recently been a large fire,
and to improve the sad event he preached a sermon,
and passed on to his own home, where he found all
well, and where he made arrangements for his voyage
to England, leaving on the 29th of December. On
that day he narrowly escaped death. A laborer was
walking behind him with a gun under his arm, which
went off unawares; happily its muzzle was towards
the ground, "otherwise," says Whitefield, "I and one
of my friends, in all probability, should have been
killed; for we were directly before, and not above a
yard or two distant from it. How ought we to live
in such a state as we would not fear to die in; for in
the midst of life we are in death!" In the evening he
preached his farewell sermon as pastor of Savannah.</p>

<p>On Mr. Whitefield's arrival at Charleston, in company
with two gentlemen named Bryan, who had been
called to suffer persecution for Christ's sake, he had
the happiness of meeting his brother, the captain of a
vessel from England, who gave him much interesting
intelligence of the Christians in that country. Commencing
with the Sabbath, he preached twice every
day, in addition to expounding the Scriptures almost
every evening, and expresses his gratitude for divine
assistance. But though he had much to rejoice in, he
had also more than one source of sorrow. Some professors
of religion, of whom he had hoped well, had
fallen away, and not a few of his enemies were even
more enraged than formerly. Hugh Bryan had written
a letter, in which, among other matters, "it was
hinted that the clergy break their canons." At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
request of Jonathan Bryan, Whitefield had corrected
it for the press, and it was published while he was
now in the city. Hugh Bryan was apprehended, and
on his examination, being asked, frankly confessed
that Whitefield had corrected and made some alterations
in it. Writing on January 10, he says, "This
evening a constable came to me with the following
warrant:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'South Carolina SS. By B&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;, etc.
Whereas I have received information upon oath that
George Whitefield, Clerk, hath made and composed a
false, malicious, scandalous, and infamous Libel against
the Clergy of this Province, in contempt of His Majesty
and His Laws, and against the King's Peace: These
are therefore, in His Majesty's Name, to charge and
command you and each of you forthwith to apprehend
the said George Whitefield, and to bring him before
Me to answer the premises. Hereof fail not, at your
peril. And for your so doing this shall be your and
each of your sufficient Warrant. Given under my
hand and seal this tenth day of January, in the fourteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign, Anno Domini one
thousand seven hundred and forty [one.]</p>

<p class="sig">
"'B&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;.'"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield gave security to appear by his attorney
at the next quarter sessions, under penalty of one hundred
pounds proclamation money. "Blessed be God,"
he says in his journal, "for this further honor. My
soul rejoices in it. I think this may be called persecution.
I think it is for righteousness' sake." The
next morning he preached on Herod sending the wise
men to find out Christ, professing a desire to worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
him, but intending to kill him; <em>persecution under pretence
of religion</em>, being his theme. The afternoon sermon
was on the murder of Naboth, from which he discoursed
on <em>the abuse of power by men in authority</em>. He
says, "My hearers, as well as myself, made the application.
It was pretty close." No doubt it was. In
the evening he expounded the narrative of Orpah and
Ruth, and exhorted his hearers to follow the Lord
Jesus Christ, though his cause be never so much persecuted
and spoken against.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday, he received several
highly gratifying letters from his friends at Boston.
Mr. Secretary Willard said to him, "Divers young
men in this town, who are candidates for the ministry,
have been brought under deep convictions by your
preaching, and are carried off from the foundation of
their false hopes to rest only upon Christ for salvation."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Cooper wrote, "I can inform you
that there are many abiding proofs that you did not
run in vain, and labor in vain among us in this place.
I can only say now in general, some have been awakened
who were before quite secure, and I hope a good
work begun in them. Others, who had been under
religious impressions, are now more earnestly pressing
into the kingdom of heaven, and many of the children
of God are stirred up to give diligence for the full
assurance of faith. There is a greater flocking to all
the lectures in the town, and the people show such a
disposition to the new Tuesday evening lecture, that
our large capacious house cannot receive all that
come. I am sure your visit to us has made a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
addition to the prayers that are going up for you in
one place and another, and I hope also unto the jewels
that are to make up your crown in the day of the
Lord."</p>

<p>In addition to these statements, Mr. Welch, a pious
merchant, wrote, "I fear I am tedious, but I cannot
break off till I just mention, to the glory of the grace
of God, and for your comfort and encouragement, the
success your ministry of late has had among us. Impressions
made seem to be abiding on the minds of
many. The doctrines of grace seem to be more the
topic of conversation than ever I knew them. Nay,
religious conversation seems to be almost <em>fashionable</em>,
and almost every one seems disposed to hear or speak
of the things of God. Multitudes flock to the evening
lecture, though it has sometimes been the worst of
weather. Ministers seem to preach with more life,
and the great auditories seem to hear with solemn
attention, and I hope our Lord Jesus is getting to
himself the victory over the hearts of many sinners."</p>

<p>These, and other letters of a similar character,
filled the heart of Whitefield with grateful pleasure;
and he went on preaching and enjoying the society of
his friends till Friday, January 16. He says, "I never
received such generous tokens of love, I think, from
any people before, as from some in Charleston. They
so loaded me with sea-stores, that I sent many of them
to Savannah." He now went on board, and was fully
engaged in preparations for the voyage, which however
was not entered on till the 24th. On that day
the <em>Minerva</em> sailed over Charleston bar, and after a
generally pleasant voyage, they landed at Falmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
March 11. "This," says he, "was a profitable voyage
to my soul, because of my having had many sweet
opportunities for reading, meditation, and prayer."</p>

<p>The impartiality of history requires us, however
reluctantly, here to notice the separation which to
some extent now took place between Whitefield, and
his old friends Messrs. John and Charles Wesley.
Their mutual attachment in early life we have already
seen, as also Whitefield's anxiety in Georgia to defend
Mr. John Wesley's conduct against those who opposed
him. Impartial observers, however, after a while began
to remark, that on some doctrinal points, especially
on that of predestination, a difference was springing
up. On his passage to England, February 1, 1741,
Whitefield thus wrote to Mr. Charles Wesley: "My
dear, dear brethren, why did you throw out the bone
of contention? Why did you print that sermon
against predestination? Why did you in particular,
my dear brother Charles, affix your hymn, and join in
putting out your late hymn-book? How can you say
you will not dispute with me about election, and yet
print such hymns? and your brother sent his sermon
against election, to Mr. Garden and others in America.
Do not you think, my dear brethren, I must be
as much concerned for truth, or what I think truth,
as you? God is my judge, I always was, and hope I
always shall be desirous that you may be preferred
before me. But I must preach the gospel of Christ,
and that I cannot <em>now</em> do, without speaking of election."
He then tells Mr. Charles Wesley, that in
Christmas-week he had written an answer to his
brother's sermon, "which," says he, "is now printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
at Charleston; another copy I have sent to Boston,
and another I now bring with me, to print in London.
If it occasion a strangeness between us, it shall not be
my fault. There is nothing in my answer exciting to
it, that I know of. O, my dear brethren, my heart
almost bleeds within me. Methinks I could be willing
to tarry here on the waters for ever, rather than
come to England to oppose you."</p>

<p>Dr. Whitehead, in his "Life of John Wesley," has
very wisely said, "Controversy almost always injures
the Christian temper, much more than it promotes the
interests of speculative truth. On this question a
separation took place between Mr. Wesley and Mr.
Whitefield, so far as to have different places of worship;
and some warm and tart expressions dropped
from each. But their good opinion of each other's
integrity and usefulness, founded on long and intimate
acquaintance, could not be injured by such a difference
of sentiment; and their mutual affection was only obscured
by a cloud for a season."</p>

<p>The friendship between Mr. Whitefield and the
Messrs. Wesley was very much increased and perpetuated
by the wife of Mr. Charles Wesley. This very
extraordinary lady, whose original name was Gwinne,
was equally distinguished for her beauty, talents, and
piety. She had a very cordial regard for Mr. Whitefield,
who as cordially reciprocated it. She was married
when the controversy among these eminent men
was at its height, and stipulated that she should
always be allowed to hear the preaching of Whitefield
and his friends. In her latter years especially, and
she lived till ninety-six, she expressed her pleasure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the belief that she promoted the continuance of that
endearing intercourse which subsisted between Whitefield
and her husband. She softened all parties, and
was on all occasions a blessed peacemaker.</p>

<p>One fact relating to this eminently excellent
woman may be mentioned. She was nearly twenty
years younger than her husband, and four years after
her marriage, and at the age of twenty-six, she was
seized with small-pox, of which at that time her eldest
child died. She lay twenty-two days in imminent
danger of death, and when she recovered she was so
much altered in features that no one could recognize
her; but never did woman before lose her beauty
with so little regret. She used sportively to say, that
the change in her appearance "afforded great satisfaction
to her dear husband, who was glad to see her
look so much older, and better suited to be his companion."</p>

<p>On Whitefield's arrival at Falmouth, he immediately
set off in a post-chaise to London, in order to
preach on the following Sabbath. But he now found
occasion for all the patience he had acquired. He
had, he says, "written two well-meant, though ill-judged
letters against England's two great favorites,
'<cite>The Whole Duty of Man</cite>,' and Archbishop Tillotson,
who, I said, knew no more about religion than Mohammed.
The Moravians had made inroads on our societies;"
besides which, the controversy with the Messrs.
Wesley injured him. His congregations on the Sabbath
were still large, but on week-days he had not
more than two or three hundred hearers. He says,
"Instead of having thousands to attend me, scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
one of my spiritual children come to see me from
morning to night. Once, on Kennington Common, I
had not above a hundred to hear me."</p>

<p>Even this was not all. He says, "One that got
some hundreds of pounds by my sermons, refused to
print for me any more. And others wrote to me, that
God would destroy me in a fortnight, and that my fall
was as great as Peter's." Still other sorrows attended
him. He writes, "I was much embarrassed in my outward
circumstances. A thousand pounds I owed for
the orphan-house. Two hundred and fifty pounds
drawn on Mr. Seward, [who was now dead,] were returned
upon me. I was also threatened to be arrested
for two hundred pounds more." Besides all this, he
had "a family of one hundred persons to be maintained,
four thousand miles off, in the dearest part of his
majesty's dominions." He now began to preach in
Moorfields on week-days, under one of the trees;
where he saw numbers of his spiritual children running
by him without looking at him, and some of them
putting their fingers in their ears, that they might not
hear one word he said. "A like scene," he says,
"opened at Bristol, where I was denied preaching in
the house I had founded." It was the Kingswood
school-house, built for the children of the colliers.</p>

<p>But Whitefield could not long be kept down. His
friends built a new house and opened a new school at
Kingswood. Some "free-grace dissenters," as Gillies
calls them, procured the loan of a building lot in London,
on which, as we have already seen, they built the
Tabernacle. Here his congregations immediately increased,
and he addressed them with his usual power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and success. Invitations soon poured in from the
country, and even from places where he had never
been. At a common near Braintree, in Essex, he had
more than ten thousand hearers, and at many other
places congregations were large and much affected.
"Sweet," says he, "was the conversation which I had
with several ministers of Christ." Soon again did he
triumph, even in England.</p>

<p>Among the men who were now invited to aid, and
who rendered important assistance to Whitefield in
his houses of worship in London and Bristol, as well
as in his itinerant labors, was Howel Harris, a native
of Wales, a gentleman, and a magistrate, to whom we
have already referred. His name in Wales is yet "a
household word," and his labors form a part of the
history of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism. As soon as
he had embraced the gospel for himself, he became
intensely solicitous respecting the condition of his
neighbors. The scenes of profligacy and vice which
everywhere presented themselves burdened his heart,
and he became anxious to be actively employed in
removing evil and doing good. He determined on
taking orders in the church of England, and accordingly
entered St. Mary's Hall, in Oxford university;
but shocked at the dissolute habits of the collegians,
and finding what were called his methodistical views
were in the way of his ordination, he returned to
Wales, and began to evangelize its towns and villages.
Wherever there was an opening, there he went, and
preached Christ to the people; and although defamed
and persecuted, he manfully prosecuted his work,
and thousands were by his agency brought to repentance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
He and Mr. Whitefield were kindred spirits,
moved by the same impulses, and pursuing the same
course. Mr. Whitefield spoke of him as "'a burning
and shining light,' a barrier against profaneness and
immorality, and an indefatigable promoter of the true
gospel of Jesus Christ. For these years he has preached
almost twice a day, for three or four hours together.
He has been in seven counties, and has made it his
business to go to wakes and fairs to turn people from
their lying vanities. He has been made the subject
of numbers of sermons, has been threatened with public
prosecutions, and had constables sent to apprehend
him. But God has blessed him with inflexible courage;
strength has been communicated to him from
above, and he still goes on from conquering to conquer.
God has greatly blessed his pious endeavors;
many call, and own him as their spiritual father, and
would, I believe, lay down their lives for his sake."</p>

<p>In the year 1759, when England was threatened
with a French invasion, Mr. Harris became a captain
in the Brecknockshire militia, and into whatever place
in England the regiment was ordered, he uniformly
began to preach, and was the means of introducing
the gospel into many ignorant and depraved districts.
Thus an unusual act and an undesirable office were
overruled to doing much good. When the regiment
was disbanded, he again regularly entered on his ministerial
duties with all his former zeal and activity.
In a word, he may justly be regarded the evangelist
of Wales.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the spirit of the energetic
ministers of Christ in those days, we quote a fact or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
two from the life of Rowland Hill; the more readily
as Howel Harris is the principal subject. In 1774,
four years after the death of Whitefield, Mr. Hill
travelled through Wales, preaching three or four
times every day; many conversions took place, which
greatly sustained him under an attack of illness; and
led to the remark in his "Journal," "My body quite
weak, but my soul was refreshed." "A like example,"
says Sidney, one of the biographers of Hill, "had
been previously before his eyes in the case of Howel
Harris, one of Mr. Whitefield's energetic followers,
who was a man of extraordinary powers of body and
mind. Harris used to relate of himself, that being
once on a journey through Wales, he was subjected to
great temptation to desert his Master's cause, when
he said, 'Satan, I'll match thee for this;' and 'so I
did,' he used to add; 'for I had not ridden many miles
before I came to a revel, where there was a show of
mountebanks, which I entered, and just as they were
commencing, I jumped into the midst of them and
cried out, 'Let us pray,' which so thunderstruck them
that they listened to me quietly, while I preached to
them a most tremendous sermon, that frightened many
of them home.' Mr. Hill greatly delighted in this
anecdote, and often said that amidst somewhat similar
scenes, he had been enabled successfully to attack the
kingdom of Satan."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>FIRST AND SECOND VISITS TO SCOTLAND&mdash;LABORS
IN ENGLAND AND WALES.<br />

1740-1744.</h3>


<p>We have seen the spirit in which Mr. Whitefield
returned to London, and the cool manner in which he
was too generally received. It is painful to say that
this coldness was not confined to enemies of the
truth; it appeared in some degree in eminent dissenting
ministers, as Watts and Bradbury, Barker, and
even, to some extent, Doddridge. A plan had a few
years before been agitated to restore the dissenters
to the church, usually called the <em>Comprehension scheme</em>,
and assuredly, under the circumstances, friendship
with Whitefield was by no means favorable to such a
plan being accomplished, though it was at this period
greatly desired by many of both parties. Still, however,
good was done; Whitefield preached, and God
was glorified. More union between Christians in advancing
the cause of Christ would have been exceedingly
desirable, but even the want of this was not
permitted to stay the progress of this man of God.</p>

<p>One of the most popular and useful ministers employed
by Whitefield and his friends at this time was
John Cennick, the author of two well-known hymns,
beginning,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Jesus, thy blood and righteousness;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone."<br /></span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>He was the preacher who, in Ireland, discoursed from
the text, "Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
clothes," which gave occasion for the Methodists
in that country to be called "<em>Swaddlers</em>." The
parents of this excellent man were Quakers, who had
been imprisoned in Reading jail for the maintenance
of their religious principles. This persecution reduced
them from respectability to want, so that, like
John Bunyan, they were forced to make shoe-laces in
prison for their support.</p>

<p>The conversion of the son was very remarkable.
His first deep and lasting religious convictions flashed
upon his mind like lightning from heaven, while walking
in the crowds of Cheapside, in London. The
effects were soon manifested; he became a new man,
pursuing a new course, and entering on a new work.
His ministry was very efficient, his views of truth
were evangelical, his public speaking popular, his zeal
so great as sometimes to lead him to preach six times
in one day&mdash;all which labors were followed with abundant
success.</p>

<p>Mr. Cennick was rather below the middle stature,
of a fair countenance, and though by no means robust
in health, he knew little of timidity. The spirit in
which he discharged his ministry may be seen in a
letter he wrote to a friend: "We sang a hymn, and
then the devil led on his servants; they began beating
a drum, and then made fires of gunpowder: at
first the poor flock was startled; but while God gave
me power to speak encouragingly to them, they waxed
bolder, and very few moved. The mob then fired
guns over the people's heads, and began to play a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
water engine upon brother Harris and myself, till we
were wet through. They also played an engine upon
us with hog's-wash and grounds of beer-barrels, and
covered us with muddy water from a ditch; they
pelted us with eggs and stones, threw baskets of dust
over us, and fired their guns so close to us that our
faces were black with the powder; but, in nothing
terrified, we remained praying. I think I never saw
or felt so great a power of God as was there. In the
midst of the confused multitude, I saw a man laboring
above measure, earnest to fill the buckets with water
to throw upon us. I asked him, 'What harm do we
do? Why are you so furious against us? We only
come to tell you that Christ loved you, and died for
you.' He stepped back a little for room, and threw a
bucket of water in my face. When I had recovered
myself, I said, 'My dear man, if God should so pour
his wrath upon you, what would become of you? Yet
I tell you that Christ loves you.' He threw away
the bucket, let fall his trembling hands, and looked
as pale as death; he then shook hands with me, and
parted from me, I believe under strong convictions."</p>

<p>Mr. Cennick had heretofore labored with Whitefield
and Wesley, but now adhered to the former, and
labored very successfully in the Tabernacle. After
some years he united with the Moravian brethren,
and died in triumph at thirty-five.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1741, some three or four months
after his arrival from America, Whitefield paid his
first visit to Scotland. The state of religion in that
country at the commencement of the ministry of this
distinguished evangelist, has been already glanced at.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
It is here important to remark, that in 1740 an indication
of better things began to appear in several
places, especially in Cambuslang, under the ministry
of the Rev. Mr. M'Culloch. This excellent man, for
nearly a year before the revival began, had been
preaching to his people on those subjects which tend
most directly to explain the nature and prove the
necessity of regeneration, according to the different
aspects in which it is represented in the holy Scriptures.
The church edifice had become too small
for the congregation, and the minister, in favorable
weather, frequently conducted the public worship on
a green brae on the east side of a deep ravine near the
church, scooped out in the form of an amphitheatre.
In this retired and romantic spot, the worthy pastor
preached in the most impressive manner to the listening
multitudes, and not unfrequently, after his sermons,
detailed to them the astonishing effects of
Whitefield's preaching in America, which did not a
little to increase the interest of the people, as well
as lead them to wish to see such an extraordinary
preacher.</p>

<p>While on his voyage to Scotland, Whitefield gave
evidence that he had not forgotten America. In his
second visit to America, he had become intimately
acquainted with the Rev. Daniel Rodgers of Exeter,
New Hampshire, a direct descendant of the seventh
generation of John Rogers, who was burnt at the
stake for the testimony of Christ in the days of the
bloody Mary. It is not surprising that Whitefield's
original letter to him, now in the possession of the
family of the grandson of Daniel Rodgers, is highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
valued. It is dated on board the Mary and Ann,
bound from London to Scotland, July 25, 1741.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother Rodgers</span>&mdash;How glad was I to
receive a letter from your hands, having heard nothing
from you or of you particularly since we parted.
Oh, what great things has the Lord shown us since
that time! methinks I hear you say; and yet I can tell
of greater things. And I believe we shall see far
greater yet before we die. The work is beginning
afresh here. I sometimes think brother Gilbert [Tennent]
must take a voyage to old England. Most of
our London ministers too much shun the cross, and do
not appear boldly for God. Now the Lord has worked
so powerfully in your college, I have less to object
against your joining Mr. Web. I am glad to hear that
you speak <em>plain and close</em>. What comfort will this
afford you in a dying hour. Go on, my dear brother,
go on; venture daily upon Christ. Go out in his
strength, and he will enable us to do wonders. He is
with me more and more. I have sweetly been carried
through the heat and burning of every day's labor.
Jesus bears all my burdens. Jesus enables me to cast
all my care upon him. Oh then, let us magnify his
name together. I am now going to Scotland, knowing
not what will befall me. What God does, you
may expect to hear of shortly. In the meanwhile, let
us pray for and write to each other. As iron sharpeneth
iron, so do the letters of a man his friend. Your
last I have printed. God's glory called me to it.</p>

<p>"My dear brother, adieu. Dear brother Sims sits
by and salutes you. My kind love awaits Mr. Web,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and all who love the Lord in sincerity. In hopes of
receiving another letter from you shortly, I subscribe
myself, dear Mr. Rodgers, your most affectionate,
though very unworthy brother and servant in the
sweetest Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"G. W."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Among those who were most anxious that Mr.
Whitefield should visit Scotland, were the Rev.
Messrs. Ebenezer and Ralph Erskine. These two
excellent brothers had separated themselves from the
established church, chiefly on the ground of its cold
formalism, and with some other zealous ministers had
formed what has since been known as the Associate
Presbytery. Their wish was, that in coming to Scotland,
Whitefield should preach only in connection with
their body, and so help forward the work in which
they were engaged. To this he objected, regarding
himself as an evangelist at large. As he proceeded,
they rather opposed him, as not sufficiently particular
and discriminative in his zeal. They wished him not
to labor in the church from which they had seceded,
saying, "God had left it." "Then," said he, "it is the
more necessary for me to preach in it, to endeavor to
bring him back. I'll preach Christ wherever they'll
let me." On the 30th of July he arrived in Edinburgh,
where he was urged to preach, but declined till he
had seen the Messrs. Erskine; and accordingly proceeded
to Dunfermline. Writing on the 1st of August,
he says, "I went yesterday to Dunfermline,
where dear Mr. Ralph Erskine hath got a large and
separate, or as it is commonly termed, seceding meeting-house.
He received me very lovingly. I preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to his and the town's people&mdash;a very thronged assembly.
After I had done prayers and named my text,
the rustling made by opening the Bibles all at once
quite surprised me&mdash;a scene I never was witness to
before."</p>

<p>On the day following, Whitefield returned to
Edinburgh, accompanied by Mr. Ralph Erskine, and
preached in the Orphan-house park to a large and
attentive audience. His text was, "The kingdom of
God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." Rom. 14:17.
After the sermon, a large company, including some of
the nobility, came to bid him God-speed; and among
others a portly Quaker, a nephew of the Messrs. Erskine,
who, taking him by the hand, said, "Friend
George, I am as thou art; I am for bringing all to
the life and power of the ever-living God; and therefore,
if thou wilt not quarrel with me about my hat, I
will not quarrel with thee about thy gown." On
Sabbath evening, he preached in the same place, to
upwards of fifteen thousand persons; and on the evenings
of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, to nearly as
many; on Tuesday in the Canongate church; on
Wednesday and Thursday at Dunfermline; and on
Friday morning at Queensferry. "Everywhere," says
he, "the auditories were large and very attentive.
Great power accompanied the word. Many have
been brought under convictions, and I have already
received invitations to different places, which, God
willing, I intend to comply with." Writing a week
later, he says, "It would make your heart leap for joy
to be now in Edinburgh. I question if there be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
upwards of three hundred in this city seeking after
Jesus. Every morning I have a constant levee of
wounded souls, many of whom are quite slain by the
law. God's power attends the word continually, just
as when I left London. At seven in the morning we
have a lecture in the fields, attended not only by the
common people, but also by persons of rank. I have
reason to think that several of the latter sort are
coming to Jesus. Little children also are much
wrought upon. God much blesses my letters from
the little orphans, [girls in the hospital.] He loves
to work by contemptible means. Oh, my dear brother,
I am quite amazed when I think what God has
done here in a fortnight. My printed sermons and
journals have been blessed in an uncommon manner.
I am only afraid lest people should idolize the instrument,
and not look enough to the glorious Jesus, in
whom alone I desire to glory. Congregations consist
of many thousands. Never did I see so many Bibles,
nor people looking into them, while I am expounding,
with so much attention. Plenty of tears flow from the
hearers' eyes. Their emotions appear in various ways.
I preach twice daily, and expound at private houses
at night, and am employed in speaking to souls under
distress great part of the day. I have just snatched a
few moments to write to my dear brother. Oh, that
God may enlarge your heart to pray for me. This
afternoon I preach out of town, and also to-morrow.
Next post, God willing, you shall have another letter.
I walk continually in the comforts of the Holy Ghost.
The love of Christ quite strikes me dumb. O grace,
grace! let that be my song. Adieu."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>In this manner Whitefield continued to preach
very extensively over Scotland; and early in September
he arrived at Glasgow. On the eleventh of that
month he began his labors in the High Church-yard,
and for five days in succession preached there twice a
day&mdash;at an early hour in the morning, and again in
the evening. The expectations of the people were
high, not only in Glasgow, but all around, and crowds
flocked to hear him preach. Morning after morning,
and evening after evening, that vast church-yard,
almost paved as it is with tombstones, was crowded
with living worshippers, trembling under the word.
But not satisfied with hearing, the pen of the ready
writer was from day to day at work, and each sermon
was printed by itself, and put immediately into circulation.
His sermons were characterized by great
simplicity, as if the language of the preacher merely
expressed what he felt, and yet there was so much
earnestness, and so much closeness of application, as
to account for the effects they produced. He was in
the pulpit very much what Baxter was in the press.
He spoke as a man realizing all that he said, and laying
open the feelings of his own heart in addressing
the hearts of others.</p>

<p>Very few men better knew the human heart than
Whitefield. He seemed to know all the thoughts and
feelings of his hearers, and the best way in which to
meet them. He once preached in Scotland from the
text, "The door was shut." Matt. 25:10. A respectable
lady who heard him sat near the door, a considerable
distance from the pulpit, and observed two
showy and trifling young men who appeared to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the solemn appeals of the preacher into ridicule; she
heard one of them say in a low tone to the other,
"Well, what if the door be shut? another will open."
In a very few minutes, to the great surprise of the
lady, Mr. Whitefield said, "It is possible there may
be some careless, trifling person here to-day, who may
ward off the force of this impressive subject by lightly
thinking, 'What matter if the door be shut? another
will open.'" The two young men looked at each
other as though they were paralyzed, as the preacher
proceeded: "Yes, another door will open; and I will
tell you what door it will be: it will be the door of
the bottomless pit, the door of hell!&mdash;the door which
conceals from the eyes of angels the horrors of damnation."</p>

<p>After Mr. Whitefield's return to England, at the
close of October, among many letters which followed
him, detailing the results of his labors, was one from
Mr. M'Culloch, the excellent minister already referred
to:</p>

<p>"As it is matter of joy and thankfulness to God,
who sent you hither, and gave you so much countenance,
and so remarkably crowned your labors with
success here at Glasgow, so I doubt not but the following
account of the many seals to your ministry in
and about that city, will be very rejoicing to your
heart, especially as the kingdom of our glorious Redeemer
is so much advanced thereby, and as the everlasting
happiness of souls is promoted. I am well
informed by some ministers, and other judicious and
experienced Christians, that there are to the amount
of fifty persons already known, in and about Glasgow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
who appear to be savingly converted, through the
blessing and power of God on your ten sermons.
And there are, besides these, several others apparently
under conviction, but not reckoned, as being
still doubtful. Several Christians also, of considerable
standing, were much strengthened, revived, and
comforted by what they heard. They were made to
rejoice in hope of the glory of God, having attained
to the full assurance of faith. Among those lately
converted, there are several young people who were
before openly wicked and flagitious, or at best but
very negligent as to spiritual things; and yet they
are now in the way of salvation. Some young converts
are yet under doubts and fears, but a considerable
number of them have attained to peace and joy in
believing. Several of those who were lately wrought
on in a gracious way, seem to outstrip Christians of
considerable standing, in spiritual-mindedness, and in
many other good qualifications; particularly in their
zeal for the conversion of others, in their love to ordinances,
and in their freedom from bigotry and party
zeal. Those converted by your ministry have not
been discovered at once, but only from time to time.
A good many of them have been discovered only of
late. Their convictions were at first less pungent,
and through the discouragements they met with in the
families where they resided, as well as from their own
feelings, they endeavored for a time to conceal their
state. These circumstances afford ground for hoping,
that there are yet others who may afterwards become
known. Besides such as have been awakened through
the power of God accompanying your sermons, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
have been others who have been since awakened, and
who have been discovered in consequence of the change
observable in their conduct. These, dear brother, are
a few hints concerning some of the most remarkable
things, as to the blessing which accompanied your
labors at Glasgow."</p>

<p>At Edinburgh, when first visited by Whitefield,
many persons of the highest rank constantly attended
his ministry. Among them were the Marquis of Lothian,
the Earl of Leven, Lord Ray, Lady Mary Hamilton,
Lady Frances Gardiner, Lady Jane Nimms, and
Lady Dirleton; and at some one of their houses he
expounded almost every evening. Numbers of ministers
and students crowded to hear him; and aged
Christians told him they could set their seal to what
he preached.</p>

<p>In connection with this first visit to Edinburgh,
several incidents have been related which show the
power that accompanied his preaching, and the skill
with which he could seize upon passing circumstances,
and apply them to the great purpose which he
always had in view. A gentleman, on returning from
one of his sermons, was met on his way home by
an eminent minister whom he usually heard, and who
expressed great surprise that he should go to hear
such a man. The gentleman replied, "Sir, when I
hear you, I am planting trees all the time; but during
the whole of Mr. Whitefield's sermon, I could not
find time to plant one." A similar instance is related
of a ship-builder, who usually could "build a ship from
stem to stern during the sermon; but under Mr. Whitefield,
could not lay a single plank."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Another narrative has been thus given. An unhappy
man who had forfeited his life to the offended
laws of his country, was executed in that neighborhood.
Mr. Whitefield mingled with the crowd collected
on the occasion, and was much impressed with
the decorum and solemnity which were observable in
the awful scene. His appearance, however, drew the
eyes of all upon him, and produced a variety of opinions
as to the motives which led him to join the multitude.</p>

<p>The next day, being Sunday, he preached to a very
large congregation in a field near the city; and in the
course of his sermon, he adverted to the scenes of the
preceding day. "I know," said he, "that many of
you may find it difficult to reconcile my appearance
yesterday with my clerical character. Many of you,
I know, will say that my moments would have been
better employed in praying for the unhappy man, than
in attending him to the fatal tree; and that perhaps
curiosity was the only cause that converted me into a
spectator on that occasion; but those who ascribe
that uncharitable motive to me, are under a mistake.
I went as an observer of human nature, and to see the
effect that such an occurrence would have on those
who witnessed it. I watched the conduct of those
who were present on that awful occasion, and I was
highly pleased with their demeanor, which has given
me a very favorable opinion of the Scottish nation.
Your sympathy was visible on your countenances;
particularly when the moment arrived that your unhappy
fellow-creature was to close his eyes on this
world for ever. Then you all, as if moved by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
impulse, turned your heads aside, and wept. Those
tears were precious, and will be held in remembrance.
How different it was when the Saviour of mankind
was extended on the cross! The Jews, instead of sympathizing
in his sorrows, triumphed in them. They
reviled him with bitter expressions, with words even
more bitter than the gall and vinegar which they
handed him to drink. Not one of all who witnessed
his pains, turned his head aside, even in the last pang.
Yes, my friends, there was <em>one</em>&mdash;that glorious luminary,"
pointing to the sun, "veiled his brightness, and
travelled on his course in tenfold night."</p>

<p>On another occasion, near the same city, and probably
in the field to which we have already referred,
under the shade of a venerable tree, in a lovely meadow,
a poor unhappy man, thinking to turn him into
ridicule, placed himself on one of the overhanging
boughs, immediately above the preacher's head, and
with monkey-like dexterity mimicking his gestures,
endeavored to raise a laugh in the audience. Guided
by the looks of some of his hearers, Whitefield caught
a glance of him, but without seeming to have noticed
him, continued his discourse. With the skill of a wise
orator, he reserved the incident for the proper place
and time. While forcibly speaking on the power and
sovereignty of divine grace, with increasing earnestness
he spoke of the unlikely objects it had often
chosen, and the unlooked for triumphs it had achieved.
As he rose to the climax of his inspiring theme, and
when in the full sweep of his eloquence, he suddenly
paused, and turning round, and pointing slowly to the
poor creature above him, he exclaimed, in a tone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
deep and thrilling pathos, "Even <em>he</em> may yet be the
subject of that free and resistless grace." It was a
shaft from the Almighty. Winged by the divine
Spirit, it struck the scoffer to the heart, and realized
in his conversion the glorious truth it contained.</p>

<p>Yet another fact may be told connected with
Whitefield and Edinburgh. When he was once there,
a regiment of soldiers were stationed in the city, in
which was a sergeant whose name was Forbes, a very
abandoned man, who, everywhere he could do so, run
in debt for liquor, with which he was almost at all
times drunk. His wife washed for the regiment, and
thus obtained a little money. She was a pious woman,
but all her attempts to reclaim her husband were unsuccessful.
During one of Mr. Whitefield's visits to
the city, she offered her husband a sum of money, if
he would for once go and hear the eloquent preacher.
This was a strong inducement, and he engaged to go.
The sermon was in a field, as no building could have
contained the audience. The sergeant was rather
early, and placed himself in the middle of the field,
that he might file off when Mr. Whitefield ascended
the pulpit; as he only wished to be able to say that
he had seen him. The crowd, however, increased;
and when the preacher appeared, they pressed forward,
and the sergeant found it impossible to get
away. The prayer produced some impression on his
mind, but the sermon convinced him of his sinfulness
and danger. He became a changed man, and showed
the reality of his conversion by living for many years
in a very penurious manner, till he had satisfied the
claims of every one of his creditors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>One fact more should be stated in connection with
this visit. Mr. James Ogilvie was one of the ministers
of Aberdeen. This city was not in that day, nor
indeed in any part of the eighteenth century, warmly
attached to a fully-exhibited gospel. At this time,
however, both Mr. Ogilvie and his colleague, Mr. Bisset,
who, as Sir Henry Moncrieff says, was the highest
of the High church, were evangelical, though otherwise
very opposite men. "Though colleagues of the
same congregation," says Whitefield, "they are very
different in their natural temper. The one is, what
they call in Scotland, a sweet-blooded man, the other
of a choleric disposition. Mr. Bisset is neither a seceder
nor quite a true kirkman, having great fault to
find with both. Soon after my arrival, dear Mr.
Ogilvie took me to pay my respects to him. He was
prepared for it, and pulled out a paper containing a
great number of insignificant queries, which I had
neither time nor inclination to answer." For several
years Mr. Ogilvie had been corresponding with Mr.
Whitefield to induce him to visit Aberdeen, hoping
that some good might be done; and as he was himself
to preach on Sabbath forenoon in presence of the
magistrates, he gave Mr. Whitefield his place. The
congregation was large, and apparently much interested.
Mr. Bisset, in the afternoon, preached against
Mr. Whitefield by name. Mr. Ogilvie, without either
consulting his friend, or noticing the conduct of his
colleague, stood up, after the sermon, and intimated to
the congregation that Mr. Whitefield would again
preach in about half an hour. The magistrates remained
in the session-house, and the people hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
back, expecting to bear a reply. Mr. Whitefield,
waiving as much as possible all controversial matter,
preached Christ. The audience was silent, solemn,
and deeply impressed. Next day, the magistrates
apologized for their minister; and as a mark of their
own respect, presented to Mr. Whitefield the freedom
of their city. The effect of this visit to Aberdeen
was great and beneficial.</p>

<p>In 1742, Mr. Whitefield again visited Scotland.
In the mean time he had heard that his dear friends
the Erskines had become greatly offended, on account
of what they considered his lax views of church government.
But notwithstanding this difference with
the seceders, he was received by great numbers, among
whom were some persons of distinction, with cordiality
and joy, and had the satisfaction of hearing
more and more of the happy fruits of his ministry.
At Edinburgh he again preached twice a day, as
before, in the Hospital-park, where a number of seats
and shades, in the form of an amphitheatre, were
erected for the accommodation of his hearers. On
the day of his arrival at Cambuslang, he preached
three times to an immense body of people, although
he had preached that same morning at Glasgow.
The last service continued till eleven o'clock; and so
much were the people interested, that Mr. M'Culloch,
after preaching till past one in the morning, could
scarcely persuade them to depart. Mr. Whitefield
himself thus describes the scene: "Persons from all
parts flocked to see, and many, from many parts, went
home convinced and converted to God. A brae, or
hill, near the manse at Cambuslang, seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
formed by Providence for containing a large congregation.
People sat unwearied till two in the morning,
to hear sermons, disregarding the weather. You
could scarcely walk a yard, but you must tread upon
some either rejoicing in God for mercies received, or
crying out for more. Thousands and thousands have
I seen, before it was possible to catch it by sympathy,
melted down under the word and power of God. At
the celebration of the holy communion, their joy was
so great, that, at the desire of many, both ministers
and people, in imitation of Hezekiah's passover, they
had, a month or two afterwards, a second, which was
a general rendezvous of the people of God. The communion
was in the field; three tents, at proper distances,
all surrounded with a multitude of hearers;
above twenty ministers, among whom was good old
Mr. Bonner, attending to preach and assist, all enlivening
and enlivened by one another."</p>

<p>In addition to his labors at Glasgow and Cambuslang,
it is surprising to observe the number of places
in the west of Scotland which Whitefield visited in
the course of a few weeks; preaching wherever he
went, with his usual frequency, energy, and success.
A gentleman of piety and intelligence thus refers to
one of them several years afterwards: "When Mr.
Whitefield was preaching at Kilmarnock, on the
twenty-third of August, from the words, 'And of his
fulness have all we received, and grace for grace,' I
thought I never heard such a sermon; and from the
era above mentioned, I have always looked upon him
as my spiritual father, and frequently heard him afterwards
in Edinburgh and Glasgow with much satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
When Cape Breton was taken, I happened to
be at Edinburgh, and being invited to breakfast with
Mr. Whitefield, I never, in all my life, enjoyed such
another breakfast. He gave the company a fine and
lively descant upon that part of the world, made us all
join in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving, and concluded
with a most devout and fervent prayer." About
the end of October, Whitefield returned to London.</p>

<p>Probably few are aware that Mr. Whitefield visited
Scotland no less than <em>fourteen</em> times. These visits
extended over a period of twenty-seven years, beginning
in 1741, and ending in 1768. In none of his
visits after 1742 were there the same extensive awakenings
as in his first two visits, yet his coming was
always refreshing to serious persons, infusing new
life, and increasing their numbers. Young people,
too, were much benefited by his ministry, and especially
young students, who afterwards became zealous
and evangelical preachers. His morning discourses,
which were generally intended for sincere but disconsolate
souls, were peculiarly fitted to direct and encourage
such in the Christian life; and his addresses
in the evening to the promiscuous multitudes who then
attended him, were powerful and alarming. There
was great solemnity in his evening congregations in
the Orphan-house park at Edinburgh and the High
Church-yard at Glasgow, especially towards the conclusion
of his sermons&mdash;which were usually long,
though they seemed short to his hearers&mdash;when the
whole multitude stood fixed, and like one man, hung
upon his lips with silent attention, and many were
under deep religious impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>His conversation was no less useful and delightful
than his sermons. Many in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
other parts of the land, bore witness of this fact. In
Glasgow especially, when in company with his excellent
friends M'Laurin, Scott, and others, one might
challenge the professed sons of pleasure, with all their
wit, humor, and gayety, to furnish entertainments so
gratifying; nor was any part of it more agreeable
than it was useful and edifying.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield's friends in Scotland, among whom
were many of all ranks, from the highest to the lowest,
were constant and steady in their great regard
for him, and his opposers from year to year became
less violent. Indeed, his whole behavior was so transparent
to the eyes of the world, and his character,
after it had stood many attacks from all quarters,
became so thoroughly established, that some of his
opposers in Scotland seemed to acquire esteem for
him; at least, they ceased to speak evil of him.</p>

<p>In closing our sketch of Whitefield in Scotland,
we select a few paragraphs from his letters, which are
the more interesting as being among the very last
words he wrote in that country. June 15, 1768, he
says, "You would be delighted to see our Orphan-house
park assemblies, as large, attentive, and affectionate
as ever. Twenty-seven-year-old friends and
spiritual children remember the days of old; they
are seeking after their first love, and there seems to
be a stirring among the dry bones." Writing on the
second of July, he says, "Could I preach ten times a
day, thousands and thousands would attend. I have
been confined for a few days; but on Monday or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Tuesday next, hope to mount my throne again. O,
to die there! too great, too great an honor to be expected."
Again, on the ninth of July, "Every thing
goes on better and better here; but I am so worn
down by preaching abroad and talking at home almost
all the day long, that I have determined, God willing,
to set off for London next Tuesday."</p>

<p>The respect with which Whitefield was treated in
Scotland, not only by professing Christians, but in
general society, was shown by the fact that he was
presented with the freedom of some of the principal
cities and towns which he visited. This privilege
was given him in Stirling, Glasgow, Paisley, and Aberdeen,
in 1741, and at Irvine and Edinburgh some
years afterwards.</p>

<p>It is difficult, in such a world as this, so to live as
that "our good" shall not "be evil spoken of." Mr.
Whitefield has sometimes been charged with motives
of a mercenary character, but his whole life showed
the fallacy of such a charge. Dr. Gillies, his original
biographer, received from unquestionable testimony
the knowledge of a fact which ought not to be forgotten.
During his stay in Scotland, in the year 1759,
a young lady, Miss Hunter, who possessed a considerable
fortune, made a full offer to him of her estate in
money and lands, worth several thousand pounds.
He promptly refused the offer; and upon his declining
it for himself, she offered it to him for the benefit
of his orphan-house. This also he absolutely refused.</p>

<p>Never could Whitefield be accused of moral cowardice.
When the old Scotch Marquis of Lothian
professed that his heart was impressed with the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of religion, but wished to be a Christian in
the dark, Whitefield said to him, "As for praying in
your family, I entreat you not to neglect it; you are
bound to do it. Apply to Christ to overcome your
present fears; they are the effects of pride or infidelity,
or both."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On his return from Scotland to London in 1741,
Whitefield passed through Wales, where at Abergavenny
he was married to a Mrs. James, a widow,
some ten years older than himself. Of this marriage,
as also of the death of his only child, we have already
spoken. After preaching at Bristol twice a day for
several days in succession, he returned to London in
the beginning of December, where he found letters
from Georgia, which, on account of the temporal circumstances
of his orphan family, somewhat discouraged
him. But to trace his progress, and to report
all his labors, would be to extend our volume beyond
its due limits.</p>

<p>He was soon again in the west of England, and
writing from Gloucester, his native place, December
23, 1741, he says, "Last Thursday evening the Lord
brought me hither. I preached immediately to our
friends in a large barn, and had my Master's presence.
Both the power and the congregation increased. On
Sunday, Providence opened a door for my preaching
in St. John's, one of the parish churches. Great numbers
came. On Sunday afternoon, after I had preached
twice at Gloucester, I preached at the hill, six
miles off, and again at night at Stroud. The people
seemed to be more hungry than ever, and the Lord to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
be more among them. Yesterday morning I preached
at Painswick, in the parish church, here in the afternoon,
and again at night in the barn. God gives me
unspeakable comfort and uninterrupted joy. Here
seems to be a new awakening, and a revival of the
work of God. I find several country people were
awakened when I preached at Tewkesbury, and have
heard of three or four that have died in the Lord.
We shall never know what good field-preaching has
done till we come to judgment. Many who were
prejudiced against me begin to be of another mind;
and God shows me more and more that 'when a man's
ways please the Lord, he will make even his enemies
to be at peace with him.'"</p>

<p>In the following February he was still further
encouraged by receiving letters from America, informing
him of the remarkable success of the gospel there,
and that God had stirred up some wealthy friends to
assist his orphans in their extremity. He writes,
"The everlasting God reward all their benefactors.
I find there has been a fresh awakening among them.
I am informed that twelve negroes belonging to a
planter lately converted at the orphan-house, are savingly
brought home to Jesus Christ." Nor were these
things all which afforded him joy. Writing to a
friend, April 6, he says, "Our Saviour is doing great
things in London daily. I rejoice to hear that you
are helped in your work. Let this encourage you;
go on, go on; the more we do, the more we may do
for Jesus. I sleep and eat but little, and am constantly
employed from morning till midnight, and yet
my strength is daily renewed. Oh, free grace! it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
fires my soul, and makes me long to do something for
Jesus. It is true, indeed, I want to go home; but
here are so many souls ready to perish for lack of
knowledge, that I am willing to tarry below as long
as my Master has work for me." It was at this period
that he first ventured to preach in the fair in
Moorfields, to which we have already referred. In
this year he made also his second journey to Scotland,
the particulars of which have been already given.</p>

<p>On his arrival from Scotland in London, October,
1742, Whitefield found a new awakening at the Tabernacle,
which in the mean time had been enlarged.
He says, "I am employed, and, glory to rich grace, I
am carried through the duties of each day with cheerfulness
and almost uninterrupted tranquillity. Our
society is large, but in good order. My Master gives
us much of his gracious presence, both in our public
and private ministrations."</p>

<p>In March, 1743, he went again into Gloucestershire,
where the people appeared to be more eager to attend
on his ministry than ever before. "Preaching," says
he, "in Gloucestershire, is now like preaching at the
Tabernacle in London." And in a letter, April 7, he
says, "I preached, and took leave of the Gloucester
people with mutual and great concern, on Sunday
evening last. It was past one in the morning before
I could lay my weary body down, At five I rose
again, sick for want of rest; but I was enabled to
get on horseback and ride to Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;'s, where I
preached to a large congregation, who came there at
seven in the morning. At ten, I read prayers and
preached, and afterwards administered the sacrament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in Stonehouse church. Then I rode to Stroud, and
preached to about twelve thousand in Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;'s
field; and about six in the evening, to a like number
on Hampton common." Next morning he preached
near Dursley to some thousands; at about seven
o'clock he reached Bristol, and preached to a full
congregation at Smith's hall; and on the following
morning, after preaching, set out for Waterford, in
South Wales, where he opened the association which
he and his brethren had agreed upon, and was several
days with them, settling the affairs of the societies.
The work in Wales, during his absence, had very
greatly extended itself, not a few of the clergy having
become converted, as well as their people. He
tells us, "The power of God at the sacrament, under
the ministry of Mr. Rowland, was enough to make a
person's heart burn within him. At seven in the morning
have I seen perhaps ten thousand from different
parts, in the midst of a sermon, crying, <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Gugunniaut</i>&mdash;<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">bendyth</i>&mdash;[glory&mdash;blessed]&mdash;ready
to leap for joy."
He continued in Wales some weeks, preaching with
great apparent success, and in the latter part of April
returned to Gloucester, after having, in about three
weeks, travelled about four hundred miles, spent three
days in attending associations, and preached about
forty times. Among the interesting events of this
journey may be reckoned the fact, that when he was
at Caermarthen the quarterly sessions were held.
When he was about to preach, the magistrates sent
him word, that if he would stay till the court rose,
they would attend on the service. He acceded to
their proposal, and they were present, with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
thousands more, including several persons of high
rank.</p>

<p>After a few weeks spent in London, preaching to
vast congregations in Moorfields, and exulting in his
accustomed success, collecting too for his beloved orphans,
so as to be able to pay all his debts, and to make
a remittance to Georgia, we again find him at Bristol,
and in a few days afterwards at Exeter. Among
the clergymen who met him there was Mr. Cennick.
As this gentleman was preaching during this visit in
the High-street of the city, he was eloquently discoursing
on the doctrine of the atonement by the
blood of Christ, when a profane butcher in the crowd
exclaimed, "If you love blood, you shall presently
have enough of it," and ran to obtain some to throw
on him. A Mr. Saunders, who was employed in conveying
persons from one place to another, though an
entire stranger to religion, from a sense of justice,
determined to defend the preacher; and when the
butcher came with a pail nearly filled with blood, he
quietly took it from him, and poured it over the
man's own head. This Mr. Saunders afterwards became
an eminent Christian. He was, till extreme old
age, the body-coachman of George III., with whom he
frequently held Christian conversation, and died happily
in 1799, at the age of eighty-nine.</p>

<p>During this visit to Bristol, Whitefield's ministry
was owned of God in the conversion of Thomas Olivers,
a young profligate Welshman. It is said, he
had so studied profanity and cursing, that he would
exemplify the richness of the Welsh language by compounding
twenty or thirty words into one long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
horrid blasphemy. He had often sang profane songs
about Whitefield, and was now induced by curiosity
to go to hear him. Being too late on the first occasion,
he went on the following evening nearly three
hours before the time. The text was, "Is not this a
brand plucked out of the fire?" Zech. 3:2. His
heart became broken with a sense of his sins, and he
was soon enabled to trust in the mercy of Christ. He
became a zealous and successful minister of Christ
among the followers of Mr. Wesley, and was the author
of the well-known hymn,</p>

<p class="center">
"The God of Abram praise," etc.
</p>

<p>In August, Whitefield returned to London, but not
to make a long stay there. "I thank you," he writes
to a correspondent, "for your kind caution to spare
myself; but evangelizing is certainly my province.
Everywhere effectual doors are opened. So far from
thinking of settling in London, I am more and more
convinced that I should go from place to place." Accordingly,
during the three last months of 1743, we
find him in a large number of places in the central
and western parts of England. At Birmingham, he
writes, "I have preached five times this day, and weak
as I am, through Christ strengthening me, I could
preach five times more." At Kidderminster he met
with a distinguished Christian merchant, a Mr. Williams,
whose published "Memoirs" have been eminently
useful. Whitefield writes, "I was kindly received by
Mr. Williams. Many friends were at his house. I
was greatly refreshed to find what a sweet savor of
good Baxter's doctrine, works, and discipline remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to this day." Nor did he, amidst all his labors, feel
his health much impaired. He observes, indeed, that
he had taken a cold, but adds, "The Lord warms my
heart."</p>

<p>In the beginning of March, 1744, he was compelled
to attend the assizes at Gloucester. During the preceding
summer, the enemies of the Methodists had
been very violent, especially at Hampton, in that
county. Forbearance in the case had ceased to be a
virtue, and Mr. Whitefield was strongly urged to appeal
to law, which in England in such cases is severe.
At the preceding sessions the rioters had been convicted,
but appealed to the assizes, a higher court.
After a full hearing, a verdict was given in favor of
Whitefield and his friends, and all the prisoners were
found guilty. This exposed each to a fine of forty
pounds, or six months' imprisonment; the rioters were
greatly alarmed, public feeling on the subject was
corrected, and the Methodists readily extended forgiveness
to the unhappy offenders.</p>

<p>Whitefield was now invited by Mr. Smith, an
American merchant then in England, in the name of
thousands, to revisit this country, and took passage
with that gentleman in a vessel sailing from Portsmouth.
But the captain refused to take him, "for fear," as he
said, "he would spoil the sailors." On this account
Mr. Whitefield was compelled to go to Plymouth, another
seaport, to accomplish his purpose. On his way,
he preached at Exeter and other places, with delightful
results. "But," he says, "the chief scene was at
Plymouth and the Dock, [now called Devonport,]
where I expected least success."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>While he was at Plymouth, four well-dressed men
came to the house of one of his particular friends, in
a kind manner inquiring after him, and desiring to
know where he lodged. Soon after, Mr. Whitefield
received a letter informing him that the writer was a
nephew of Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, an attorney in New York;
that he had the pleasure of supping with Mr. Whitefield
at his uncle's house, and requested his company
to sup with him and a few friends at a tavern. Mr.
Whitefield replied to him that he was not accustomed
to sup abroad at such houses, but he should be glad
of the gentleman's company to eat a morsel with him
at his own lodging. The gentleman accordingly came
and supped, but was observed frequently to look
around him, and to be very absent. At length he took
his leave, and returned to his companions in the tavern,
and on being asked by them what he had done, he answered,
that he had been treated with so much civility
and kindness that he had not the heart to touch him.
One of the company, a lieutenant of a man-of-war, laid
a wager of ten guineas that he would do his business
for him. His companions, however, had the precaution
to take away his sword.</p>

<p>It was now about midnight, and Mr. Whitefield
having that day preached to a large congregation,
and visited the French prisoners, had retired to rest,
when he was awoke and told that a well-dressed gentleman
earnestly wished to speak with him. Supposing
that it was some person under conviction of sin,
many such having previously called upon him, he desired
him to be brought to his room. The gentleman
came, sat down by his bedside, congratulated him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon the success of his ministry, and expressed considerable
regret that he had been prevented from
hearing him. Soon after, however, he began to utter
the most abusive language, and in a cruel and cowardly
manner beat him in his bed. The landlady
and her daughter, hearing the noise, rushed into the
room and laid hold of the assailant; but disengaging
himself from them, he renewed his attack on the unoffending
preacher, who, supposing that he was about
to be shot or stabbed, underwent all the feelings of a
sudden and violent death. Soon after, a second person
came into the house, and called from the bottom
of the stairs, "Take courage, I am ready to help you."
But by the repeated cries of murder the neighborhood
had become so alarmed, that the villains were glad
to make their escape. "The next morning," says Mr.
Whitefield, "I was to expound at a private house,
and then to set out for Biddeford. Some urged me to
stay and prosecute, but being better employed, I went
on my intended journey, was greatly blessed in preaching
the everlasting gospel; and, upon my return, was
well paid for what I had suffered, curiosity having
led perhaps two thousand more than ordinary to see
and hear a man that had like to have been murdered
in his bed. And I trust, in the five weeks that I waited
for the convoy, hundreds were awakened and turned
unto the Lord."</p>

<p>As Whitefield was one day preaching in Plymouth,
a Mr. Henry Tanner, who was at work as a ship-builder
at a distance, heard his voice, and resolved,
with five or six of his companions, to go and drive
him from the place where he stood; and for this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they filled their pockets with stones. When,
however, Mr. Tanner drew near, and heard Mr.
Whitefield earnestly inviting sinners to Christ, he
was filled with astonishment, his resolution failed
him, and he went home with his mind deeply impressed.
On the following evening, he again attended,
and heard Mr. Whitefield on the sin of those who
crucified the Redeemer. After he had forcibly illustrated
their guilt, he appeared to look intently on Mr.
Tanner, as he exclaimed, with great energy, "Thou
art the man!" These words powerfully impressed
Mr. Tanner; he felt his transgressions of the divine
law to be awfully great, and in the agony of his soul
he cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" The
preacher then proceeded to proclaim the free and
abundant grace of the Lord Jesus, which he commanded
to be preached among the very people who
had murdered him; a gleam of hope entered the heart
of the penitent, and he surrendered himself to Christ.
Mr. Tanner afterwards entered the ministry, and labored
with great success, for many years, at Exeter.</p>

<p>We are not quite certain whether it was on this
or a subsequent visit to Plymouth, that Whitefield
had preached on the Sabbath for the Rev. Mr. Kinsman,
and after breakfast on Monday morning, said to
him, "Come, let us visit some of your poor people.
It is not enough that we labor in the pulpit; we must
endeavor to be useful out of it." On entering the
dwellings of the afflicted poor, he administered to
their temporal as well as their spiritual wants. Mr.
Kinsman, knowing the low state of his finances, was
surprised at his liberality, and suggested that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
thought he had been too bountiful. Mr. Whitefield,
with some degree of smartness, replied, "It is not
enough, young man, to pray, and put on a serious
face; true religion, and undefiled, is this, to visit the
widow and the fatherless in their affliction, and to
supply their wants. My stock, it is true, is nearly
exhausted; but God, whom I serve, and whose saints
we have assisted, will, I doubt not, soon give me a
supply." His expectation was not disappointed. A
stranger called on him the same evening, who said,
"With great pleasure I have heard you preach; you
are on a journey, as well as myself, and travelling is
expensive. Do me the honor to accept of this;"
handing him five guineas, or twenty-five dollars. Returning
to the family, Mr. Whitefield, very pleasantly
smiling, showed them the money, saying, "There,
young man, God has very speedily repaid what I lent
him this morning. Let this in future teach you not to
withhold what it is in the power of your hand to give.
The gentleman to whom I was called is a perfect stranger
to me; his only business was to give me the sum
you see." It was a singular fact, that this gentleman,
though rich, was notorious for a penurious disposition.</p>

<p>During his stay in Plymouth, Whitefield's usefulness
daily increased. The ferry-men, who obtained
their living by carrying persons between Plymouth
and Dock, refused to take money from his hearers,
saying, "God forbid that we should sell his word!"
The evangelist exclaimed, "Oh, the thousands that
flock to the preaching of Christ's gospel!" In the
midst of these scenes, the convoy arrived, and in delicate
health he embarked for America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>WHITEFIELD'S SECOND VISIT TO NEW ENGLAND.<br />

1744, 1745.</h3>


<p>Mr. Whitefield commenced his third voyage to
America in August, 1744. His health while crossing
the Atlantic became worse, rather than better, the
voyage lasting eleven weeks. He had set out in
company with about one hundred and fifty ships,
attended by several men-of-war as convoys, which,
however, they lost by storms separating them on the
way. It was more than six weeks, owing generally
to want of wind, before they reached any of the western
islands. When the wind again sprung up, one of
the vessels, which missed stays, drove upon the ship
in which Whitefield was, striking her mainsail into
the bowsprit. The alarm was very great, but no
lives were lost. He had been singing a hymn on
deck when the concussion took place; this fact, together
with that of the concussion itself, was communicated
to the convoy, and led to the use of much violent
and wicked language. But the good man was not
intimidated. He says, "I called my friends together,
and broke out into these words in prayer: 'God of
the sea, and God of the dry land, this is a night of
rebuke and blasphemy. Show thyself, O God, and
take us under thine own immediate protection. Be
thou our convoy, and make a difference between those
who fear thee, and those that fear thee not.'" A difference
was soon made. Next day a heavy storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
arose, which "battered and sent away our convoy, so
that we saw him no more all the voyage." Whitefield
at first did not at all regret the loss, but when
two strange sails appeared in the distance, and preparation
was made for action by mounting guns, slinging
hammocks on the sides of the ships, and encircling the
masts with chains, he being, as he says, "naturally a
coward," found it formidable to have no convoy. The
vessels, however, proved to be only a part of their
own fleet. This was a pleasant discovery to them,
especially to Whitefield. "The captain, on clearing
the cabin, said, 'After all, this is the best fighting.'
You may be sure I concurred, praying that all our
conflicts with spiritual enemies might at last terminate
in a thorough cleansing and an eternal purification
of the defiled <em>cabin</em> of our hearts."</p>

<p>The tediousness of this voyage, in the feeble state
of his health, seems to have tried Whitefield's patience;
so that when he arrived in sight of the port
of York, in the then territory of Maine, in order to
land a few hours sooner he went on board a fishing
smack then in the bay; but darkness coming on, she
missed her course, and was tossed about all night.
Unfortunately, too, she had no provisions, and he was
so hungry that he says he "could have gnawed the
very boards." Besides he was suffering from "nervous
colic." He was greatly discouraged, until a
man who was lying at his elbow in the cabin began
to talk of "one Mr. Whitefield, for whose arrival the
'New Lights' in New England" were watching and
praying. "This," he says, "made me take courage.
I continued undiscovered; and in a few hours, in answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
I trust, to <em>new-light</em> prayers, we arrived safe."
This was on October 19, 1744. He was quite ill
when he landed; but was received by Dr. Sherburne,
an eminent physician at York, who was once a Deist,
but had been converted under Whitefield's ministry.
This gentleman took him to his own house, and after
a few days he began to recover.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Moody, of York, the aged and excellent,
but eccentric minister of whom we have already
spoken, took the earliest suitable opportunity of calling
on the great evangelist, and said very characteristically,
"Sir, you are, first, welcome to America;
secondly, to New England; thirdly, to all faithful
ministers in New England; fourthly, to all the good
people of New England; fifthly, to all the good people
of York; and sixthly and lastly, to me, dear sir,
less than the least of all." Prince's "Christian History"
had announced his arrival, and that his intention
was "to pass on to Georgia; and as he goes on,
to meddle with no controversies, but only to preach
up the parts of vital piety and the pure truths of the
gospel, to all who are willing to hear them."</p>

<p>After giving Whitefield this hearty welcome,
Moody urged him for a sermon. The preacher hesitated,
on account of his illness, but "good old Mr.
Moody" did not give him the benefit of his own favorite
maxim, "When you know not what to do, you
must <em>not</em> do you know not what." Whitefield preached,
and immediately went to Portsmouth, where he
preached the same evening, November 6, for Mr.
Fitch, and was to have preached again the next morning,
but was too ill, and deferred it till the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
In the mean time, as he wrote, "My pains returned;
but what gave me most concern was, that notice had
been given of my being engaged to preach. I felt a
divine life, distinct from my animal life, which made
me, as it were, laugh at my pains, though every one
thought I was taken with death. My dear York
physician was then about to administer a medicine.
I on a sudden cried out, 'Doctor, my pains are suspended;
by the help of God, I will go and preach,
and then come home and die.' With some difficulty
I reached the pulpit. All looked quite surprised, as
though they saw one risen from the dead. I indeed
was as pale as death, and told them they must look
upon me as a dying man, come to bear my dying testimony
to the truths I had formerly preached to them.
All seemed melted, and were drowned in tears. The
cry after me, when I left the pulpit, was like the cry
of sincere mourners when attending the funeral of a
dear departed friend. Upon my coming home, I was
laid upon a bed on the ground, near the fire, and I
heard them say, 'He is gone.' But God was pleased
to order it otherwise. I gradually recovered."</p>

<p>In another account he himself says, "In my own
apprehension, and in all appearance to others, I was
a dying man. I preached&mdash;the people heard me&mdash;as
such. The invisible realities of another world lay
open to my view. Expecting to launch into eternity,
and to be with my Master before the morning, I spoke
with peculiar energy. Such effects followed the word,
I thought it was worth dying for a thousand times.
Though wonderfully comforted within at my return
home, I thought I was dying indeed.... Soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a poor negro woman would see me. She came, sat
down upon the ground, and looked earnestly in my
face, and then said, 'Massa, you just go to heaven's
gate, but Jesus Christ said, Get you down, get you
down; you must not come here yet; but go first, and
call some more poor negroes.' I prayed to the Lord,
that if I was to live, this might be the event."</p>

<p>It was nearly three weeks before he was sufficiently
recovered to proceed to Boston. The day before he
left Portsmouth Mr. Shurtleff wrote, "The prejudices
of most that set themselves against him before his
coming, seem to be in a great measure abated, and in
some, to be wholly removed; and there is no open
opposition made to him. I have frequent opportunities
of being with him, and there always appears in
him such a concern for the advancement of the Redeemer's
kingdom and the good of souls, such a care
to employ his whole time to these purposes, such
sweetness of disposition, and so much of the temper
of his great Lord and Master, that every time I see
him, I find my heart further drawn out towards him."</p>

<p>"Prince's Christian History," of December 15, says,
"The Rev. Mr. Whitefield was so far revived as to be
able to take coach with his consort, and set out from
Portsmouth to Boston, Nov. 24; whither he came in
a very feeble state, the Monday evening after; since
which he has been able to preach in several of our
largest houses of public worship, particularly the Rev.
Dr. Colman's, Dr. Sewall's, Mr. Webb's, and Mr.
Gee's, to crowded assemblies of people, and to great
and growing acceptance. At Dr. Colman's desire,
and with the consent of the church, on the Lord's day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
after his arrival, he administered to them the holy
communion. And last Lord's day he preached for the
venerable Mr. Cheever, of Chelsea, and administered
the holy supper there. The next day he preached for
the Rev. Mr. Emerson, of Malden. Yesterday he set
out to preach for some towns to the northward; proposes
to return hither the next Wednesday evening,
and after a few days to comply with the earnest
invitations of several ministers to go and preach to
their congregations, in the southern parts of the province.</p>

<p>"He comes with the same extraordinary spirit of
meekness, sweetness, and universal benevolence as
before. In opposition to the spirit of separation and
bigotry, he is still for holding communion with all
Protestant churches. In opposition to enthusiasm,
he preaches a close adherence to the Scriptures, the
necessity of trying all impressions by them, and of
rejecting whatever is not agreeable to them, as delusions.
In opposition to Antinomianism, he preaches
up all kinds of relative and religious duties, though
to be performed in the strength of Christ; and, in
short, the doctrines of the church of England, and the
first fathers of this country. As before, he first
applies himself to the understandings of his hearers,
and then to the affections; and the more he preaches,
the more he convinces people of their mistakes about
him, and increases their satisfaction."</p>

<p>The administration of the Lord's supper by a priest
of the church of England in the Congregational church
in Brattle-street, Boston, gave great offence. Some
said, the consent of the church was neither given nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
asked, and Dr. Colman was blamed for introducing
Whitefield by his own authority; to which Dr. Colman
replied, that, as it was customary for pastors to
invite the assistance of other ministers on such occasions,
he thought it unnecessary to call for a vote of
the church; that he plainly intimated his intention in
his prayer after sermon, and then, on coming to the
table, said, "The Rev. Mr. Whitefield being providentially
with us, I have asked him to administer the
ordinance;" and that by the countenances of the people
it seemed to be universally agreeable to them,
which he supposed to be all the consent which the
case required.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Whitefield's former visit to New England,
a considerable change had taken place in not a
few of the ministers and churches. In 1740, he had
inveighed strongly against many of the ministers, some
of them even by name, as, in his opinion, unconverted;
and after his departure, some preachers, who professed
themselves to be his followers, had created great
confusion by carrying these charges much farther than
he would have approved. His second visit was therefore
anticipated by many with anxiety, lest it might
cause a new outbreak of enthusiasm and disorder.
The General Association of Connecticut, in June,
1745, advised that he be not invited to preach in any
of the churches. When he visited New Haven, he
found himself shut out of the pulpit of the First church
by its minister Mr. Noyes. A great crowd, however,
assembled to hear him, from the neighboring towns,
as well as from New Haven, and he preached from a
platform erected in the street, before Mr. Pierpont's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
house on the Green, to a congregation which neither
of the meeting-houses could have contained.</p>

<p>From Professor Kingsley's "Sketch of the History
of Yale College," we learn that "President Clap
issued a declaration, signed by himself and three
tutors, that is, Samuel Whittlesey, afterwards minister
of the First church in New Haven, Thomas Darling,
for many years chief justice of the Court of Common
Pleas for the county of New Haven, and John
Whiting, in which some of the proceedings of Mr.
Whitefield were condemned. In consequence of the
religious fervor which had been excited, a much greater
diversity of theological opinions prevailed in Connecticut
than at any previous period. Violent controversies
arose, churches were divided, and the government,
by interfering to prevent these evils, increased
rather than checked them. The college became an
object of jealousy; and the declaration of the rector
and tutors, respecting the preaching of Whitefield,
offended some, without effectually conciliating others."</p>

<p>The opposition to Mr. Whitefield of which we
have spoken, was by no means all that he met with.
Even before the Association in Connecticut had taken
action, several similar bodies in Massachusetts had
acted in a similar manner. The corporation of Harvard
college published a testimony against him, while
that of Yale represented that he intended to root out
all the standing ministers in our land, and to introduce
foreigners in their stead. The good man, notwithstanding
all this opposition, and much more, went
on laboring for the salvation of souls, and God still
honored him with success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>While the impartiality to which we hold ourselves
bound demanded the statement just made, and while
we are compelled to admit the existence of evils
attendant on these revivals, we also record some of
the facts connected with a convention of ministers,
who assembled in Boston in pursuance of a previous
notice in the Boston Gazette of May 30, 1743. We
copy the original invitation.</p>

<p>"It is desired and proposed by a number of ministers,
both in town and country, that such of their
brethren as are persuaded that there has been of late
a happy revival of religion through an extraordinary
divine influence, in many parts of this land, and are
concerned for the honor and progress of this remarkable
work of God, may have an interview at Boston,
the day after the approaching commencement, to consider
whether they are not called to give an open,
conjunct testimony to an event so surprising and gracious;
as well as against those errors in doctrine, and
disorders in practice, which through the permitted
agency of Satan have attended it, and in any measure
blemished its glory and hindered its advancement;
and also to consult as to the most likely method to be
taken to guard people against such delusions and mistakes
as in such a season they are in danger of falling
into, and that this blessed work may continue and
flourish among us." Those who could not be present
were invited to send written attestations.</p>

<p>In accordance with this proposal, the convention
met in Boston on Thursday, July 7. The Rev. Dr.
Sewall of Boston officiated as Moderator, and the Rev.
Messrs. Prince of Boston, and Hobby of Reading, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Scribes. Ninety persons thus assembled, and letters
were read from twenty-eight who were absent. A
committee was appointed, consisting of the Rev. Dr.
Sewall, the Rev. Messrs. Wigglesworth, Prince, Adams,
Cooper, Nathanael Rogers, Leonard, and Hobby,
to prepare a report. On the next morning this committee
presented a document, which, after full discussion,
was signed by all present; and the meeting was
dissolved.</p>

<p>Our limits will not allow us to give the whole of
the report to which we have referred, but a few sentences
will show its general character:</p>

<p>"We, whose names are undersigned, think it our
indispensable duty&mdash;without judging or censuring such
of our brethren as cannot at present see things in the
same light with us&mdash;in this open and conjunct manner
to declare, to the glory of sovereign grace, our full
persuasion, either from what we have seen ourselves,
or received upon credible testimony, that there has
been a happy and remarkable revival of religion in
many parts of this land, through an uncommon divine
influence, after a long time of decay and deadness, and a
sensible and very awful withdrawal of the Holy Spirit
from his sanctuary among us.... The present work
seems to be remarkable and extraordinary, on account
of the numbers wrought upon. We never before saw
so many brought under soul concern, and with great
distress making the inquiry, 'What must we do to
be saved?' And these persons were of all ages and
character. With regard to the suddenness and quick
progress of it, many persons and places were surprised
with the gracious visit together, or near about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
same time, and the heavenly influence diffused itself
far and wide, like the light of the morning. Also
[the work seems to be remarkable] in respect to the
degree of operations, both in a way of terror, and in
a way of consolation, attended in many with unusual
bodily effects. Not that all who are accounted the
subjects of the present work have had these extraordinary
degrees of previous distress and subsequent joy.
But many, and we suppose the greater number, have
been wrought on in a more gentle and silent way,
and without any other appearances than are common
and usual at other times, when persons have been
awakened to a solemn concern about salvation, and
have been thought to have passed out of a state of
nature into a state of grace. As to those whose inward
concern has occasioned extraordinary outward
distresses, the most of them, when we came to converse
with them, were able to give what appeared to
us a rational account of what so affected their
minds.... The instances were very few in which
we had reason to think these affections were produced
by visionary or sensible representations, or by any
other images than such as the Scripture itself presents
to us. Of those who were judged hopefully converted,
and made a public profession of religion, there
have been fewer instances of scandal and apostasy
than might be expected.... There appears to be
more experimental godliness and lively Christianity
than most of us can remember we have ever seen before....
And now we desire to bow the knee in
thanksgiving to the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that our eyes have seen and our ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
heard such things. And while these are our sentiments,
we must necessarily be grieved at any accounts
sent abroad representing this work as all enthusiasm,
delusion, and disorder. Indeed, it is not to be denied,
that in some places many irregularities and extravagances
have been permitted to accompany it, which
we would deeply bewail and lament before God, and
look upon ourselves obliged, for the honor of the
Holy Spirit, and of his operations on the souls of
men, to bear a public and faithful testimony against;
though at the same time it is to be acknowledged,
with much thankfulness, that in other places where
the work has greatly flourished, there have been few
if any of those disorders and excesses. But who can
wonder if, at such a time as this, Satan should intermingle
himself to hinder and blemish a work so
directly contrary to the interests of his own kingdom?...
Finally, we exhort the children of God to
continue instant in prayer, that He, with whom is the
residue of the Spirit, would grant us fresh, more plentiful,
and extensive effusions, that so this wilderness,
in all the parts of it, may become a fruitful field;
that the present appearances may be an earnest of the
glorious things promised in the latter days, when she
shall shine with the glory of the Lord arisen upon
her, so as to dazzle the eyes of beholders, confound
and put to shame all her enemies, rejoice the hearts of
her solicitous and now saddened friends, and have
a strong influence and resplendency throughout the
earth. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus; come
quickly."</p>

<p>This paper was signed by eighteen ministers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
county of Suffolk, among whom were Colman, Sewall,
Prince, Webb, Cooper, Foxcroft, Checkly, Gee, Eliot,
and Moorhead of Boston; twelve in the county of
Essex, nine in Middlesex, six in Worcester, ten in
Plymouth, one in Barnstable, three in Bristol, three
in York, five in New Hampshire, and one in Rhode
Island. There were one hundred and fourteen in all
who gave attestations, either by signing their names
to the above document, or by sending written attestations.
Ninety-six of the one hundred and fourteen
took their first degree of Bachelor of Arts more than
ten years previously; consequently before the revival
commenced. Twenty-six took their first degrees
above thirty years before. Attestations were received
but from twelve ministers in Connecticut, as the proposal
did not reach them in time.</p>

<p>We may add to this statement, as showing in some
degree the extent of this revival, that while in 1729
the number of members in the Congregational and
Presbyterian churches of this country may be estimated
at thirty-three thousand, the number of communicants
in 1745 could not be less than seventy-five
thousand. "The <em>special</em> revivals of religion," says an
able writer in the "American Quarterly Register,"
vol. 4, 1832, "were probably the means of adding
from twenty thousand to thirty thousand members to
the churches." The same writer adds, "The genuine
fruits of holiness appeared, according to the acknowledgment
of all parties, in multitudes of those
who professed religion. They were Christians, who
endured unto the end. This is the unanimous testimony
of those men who were the best able to judge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Great numbers who were convinced of sin by Mr.
Whitefield's preaching, gave ample evidence, living
and dying, of sincere and fervent love to the commands
of God. There is reason to believe that a
<em>preparation</em> had been made for the descent of the Holy
Spirit, many years before the revival commenced. The
fasts and public reformations, the prayers and tears of
good men, from 1700 to 1730, were not in vain."</p>

<p>One fact connected with the testimony against
Whitefield, published by the faculty of Harvard college,
we quote, as showing that then, as well as now,
a difference of opinion existed as to written and extempore
sermons. They thought his extempore manner
of preaching "by no means proper," because extempore
preachers are of necessity less instructive,
the greater part of the sermon being commonly "the
same kind of harangue which they have often used
before, so that this is a most lazy manner" of preaching;
and because it exposes the preacher to utter rash
expressions, and even dangerous errors, as Whitefield,
they thought, had done in several instances, probably
from that cause. Assuredly he preferred extempore
preaching to any other; yet he never pretended to
preach without previous study. His sermons usually
cost him as much previous labor as if they had been
written; so that, in his case at least, it was not "a
lazy way" of preaching. The errors which they said
he had uttered, were a few hasty expressions, which
he had retracted as soon as he had been reminded of
them.</p>

<p>Itinerancy, which had also been objected against
Whitefield as one of his crimes, he strenuously defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as scriptural and right; understanding an
evangelist to be, what they said an itinerant was,
"One that hath no particular charge of his own, but
goes about from country to country, or from town to
town in any country, and stands ready to preach to
any congregation that shall call him to it." For the
divine command, "Go ye into all the world, and
preach the gospel to every creature," he argued, "authorizes
the ministers of Christ, even to the end of
the world, to preach the gospel in every town and
country, though not 'of their own head,' yet whenever
and wherever Providence should open a door, even
though it should be in a place 'where officers are
already settled, and the gospel is fully and faithfully
preached.' This, I humbly apprehend, is every gospel
minister's indisputable privilege." He further asked,
"Was not the Reformation begun and carried on by
itinerant preaching?" He then quoted from "Baxter's
Reformed Pastor," a plan which had been adopted
in some parts of England, for circular lectures by
settled ministers selected for the purpose, and with
the consent of the pastors.</p>

<p>In reference to Harvard college, Whitefield lived
long enough to take a Christian's revenge. In 1764,
he solicited from his friends donations of books for
their library, which had recently been destroyed by
fire, and four years afterwards, while his old opponent
President Holyoke was yet in office, the following
minute was entered on their records: "At a
meeting of the President and Fellows of Harvard college,
August 22, 1768, the Rev. G. Whitefield having,
in addition to his former kindness to Harvard college,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
lately presented to the library a new edition of his
Journals, and having procured large benefactions from
several benevolent and respectable gentlemen; <em>voted</em>,
that the thanks of the corporation be given to the
Rev. Mr. Whitefield, for these instances of candor
and generosity."</p>

<p>It will be readily supposed, that notwithstanding
all the opposition which Whitefield met, there were
yet many thousands always ready to attend on his
ministry. It was now the close of 1744, but the cold
of winter did not prevent vast crowds assembling at
early services long before daylight. Speaking of the
opposition he met, "so that," says he, "for a while
my situation was rendered uncomfortable," he adds,
"But amidst all this smoke a blessed fire broke out.
The awakened souls were as eager as ever to hear
the word. Having heard that I expounded early in
Scotland, they begged that I would do the same in
Boston. I complied, and opened a lecture at six in
the morning. I seldom preached to less than two
thousand. It was delightful to see so many of both
sexes neatly dressed flocking to hear the word, and
returning home to family prayer and breakfast before
the opposers were out of their beds."</p>

<p>The late Rev. Dr. Archibald Alexander tells us,
that when he was at Boston, in 1800, he found in the
Old South church a lingering relic of Whitefield's
times, in a convert of his day, a lady between eighty
and ninety years of age, who belonged to a prayer-meeting
founded then, which had been kept up weekly
until within a few years. Of this, she was the only
surviving member.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Evening Post," which seems to have been
on the side of those who opposed Whitefield, in its
issue of March 11, 1745, says, "Prince, Webb, Foxcroft,
and Gee, are the directors of Mr. Whitefield's
public conduct, as he himself has lately declared at
Newbury." He had other powerful friends among
the clergy, and still more among the laity, who invited
him by vote into some pulpits where the pastors were
"shy" of him.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, we find him at Ipswich,
where he spent several days. Mr. Pickering, of the
Second church, declined admitting him into his pulpit,
and assigned his reasons in a letter, which was published.
It contains the usual objections set forth in
the various "testimonies," and is remarkable only for
one convenient metaphor. The Bishop of London had
published on "Lukewarmness and Enthusiasm." Whitefield
had said in reply, "All ought to be thankful to
that pilot who will teach them to steer a safe and
middle course;" and Pickering wittily asks, "But
what if the pilot should take the vane for the compass?"</p>

<p>Early in March we find him making an excursion
into the east, as we hear of him both at Berwick and
Portland, in the then territory of Maine. In the latter
place, he not only made a powerful impression on
the people, but on their minister. In the outset a
strong feeling existed against his preaching in the
pulpit of the First church. Mr. Smith, the pastor,
says in his "Journal," "The parish are like to be in a
flame on account of Mr. Whitefield's coming; the leading
men violently opposing." Under the date of May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
19, after Whitefield's departure, we find in the "Journal"
a remarkable passage: "For several Sabbaths,
and the lecture, I have been all in a blaze; never in
such a flame, and what I would attend to is, that it
was not only involuntary, but actually determined
against. I went to meeting resolving to be calm and
moderate, lest people should think it was wildness
and affectation to ape Mr. Whitefield; but God, I
see, makes use of me as he pleases, and I am only a
machine in his hand."</p>

<p>About the middle of March, we find our evangelist
at Exeter, where he afterwards preached his last sermon.
Here some of the more zealous members of the
church had withdrawn, and formed a new church.
Their conduct had been sanctioned by one council,
and censured by another, two years before this time.
Whitefield preached to them twice, though Mr. Odlin,
the pastor of the church from which they had withdrawn,
"solemnly warned and charged him against
preaching in his parish." So says the "Evening Post,"
of March 25, which further calls the people to whom
he preached, "Separatists."</p>

<p>In this spring of 1745, the first expedition for the
capture from the French of the island of Cape Breton,
near Nova Scotia, was set on foot. Colonel Pepperell,
a warm personal friend of Whitefield, and the only
native of New England who was created a Baronet of
Great Britain, was then at Boston, constantly attending
Whitefield's lectures. On the day before he accepted
a commission to be general in that expedition,
he asked his opinion of the matter, and was told, with
the preacher's usual frankness, that he did not indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
think that the scheme proposed for taking Louisburgh
would be very promising; and that the eyes of all
would be upon him. If he did not succeed, the widows
and orphans of the slain soldiers would be like
lions robbed of their whelps; but if it pleased God to
give him success, envy would endeavor to eclipse his
glory: he had need, therefore, if he went, to go with
a single eye; and then there was no doubt, if Providence
really called him, he would find his strength
equal to the difficulties with which he would have to
contend.</p>

<p>About the same time, Mr. Sherburne, another of
Whitefield's friends, being appointed one of the commissioners,
told him he must favor the expedition,
otherwise the pious people would be discouraged from
enlisting; not only did he say this, but he insisted
that the evangelist should give him a motto for his
flag, for the encouragement of his soldiers. Whitefield
refused to do this, as it would not be consistent
with his character as a minister of the gospel of peace.
But as Sherburne would take no denial, he gave him,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum, Christo Duce</i>&mdash;[Nothing to be despaired
of, Christ being leader.] In these circumstances
a large number of men enlisted.</p>

<p>The soldiers and their officers now went farther,
and before their embarkation requested him to give
them a sermon. He preached to them from the text,
"And every one that was in distress, and every one
that was in debt, and every one that was discontented,
gathered themselves unto him; and he became
a captain over them." 1 Samuel 22:2. From this
somewhat singular text, he discoursed on the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in which distressed sinners came to Jesus Christ, the
Son of David; and in his application, exhorted the
soldiers to behave like the soldiers of David, and the
officers to act like David's worthies; saying, that if
they did so, there would be good news from Cape
Breton. After this he preached to the general himself,
who invited him to become one of his chaplains.
Whitefield declined this, saying, that though he should
esteem this an honor, yet, as he generally preached
three times a day, to large congregations, he could
do more service by stirring up the people to pray,
thus strengthening the hearts and hands of the army.
In this practice he persevered during the whole siege
of Louisburgh. "I believe," said he, "if ever people
went with a disinterested view, the New Englanders
did then. Though many of them were raw and undisciplined,
yet numbers were substantial persons, who
left their farms and willingly ventured all for their
country's good. An amazing series of providences
appeared, and though some discouraging accounts
were sent during the latter end of the siege, yet in
about six weeks news came of the surrender of Louisburgh.
Numbers flocked from all quarters to hear a
thanksgiving sermon upon the occasion. And I trust
the blessing bestowed upon the country through the
thanksgivings of many, redounded to the glory of
God."</p>

<p>Some time before this, the people of Boston had
proposed to build for Whitefield "the largest place
of worship ever seen in America," in which he should
regularly preach; but, as usual, he feared this plan
would abridge his liberty of itinerating: he thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
them for their offer, but decidedly declined to accept
it. As his bodily strength increased, he began to
move southward, and went through Rhode Island and
Connecticut, preaching to thousands generally twice
a day. He says, "Though there was much smoke, yet
every day I had more and more convincing proof that
a blessed gospel fire had been kindled in the hearts
both of ministers and people."</p>

<p>About this time occurred a fact which delightfully
shows how the enemies of this admirable man were
often converted into friends. A colored trumpeter
belonging to the English army resolved to interrupt
him while delivering a sermon in the open air.
For this purpose he went to the field, carrying his
trumpet with him, intending to blow it with all his
might about the middle of the sermon. He took his
station in front of the minister, and at no great distance
from him. The crowd became very great, and
those who were towards the extremity pressed forward,
that they might hear more distinctly, and caused
such a pressure where the poor trumpeter stood, that
he found it impossible at the time when he intended
to blow his trumpet, to raise the arm which held it,
by which means he was kept within the sound of the
gospel as effectually as if he had been chained to the
spot. In a short time his attention was powerfully
arrested, and he became so deeply affected by the
statements of the preacher, that he was seized with
all the agonies of despair, and was carried to a
house in the neighborhood. After the service, he
was visited by Mr. Whitefield, who gave him suitable
counsels, and from that time the trumpeter became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
greatly altered man. So true is it in reference to the
omnipotent and gracious Being,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Hearts base as hell he can control,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And spread new powers throughout the whole."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>While preaching at Boston, he was delighted to
observe that the sheriff, who had heretofore been the
leader of the persecution against him, now began to
hear him preach; and his pleasure was vastly increased,
when he saw the crowds come around him
to inquire as to their highest interests.</p>

<p>Among these crowds was a somewhat remarkable
gentleman of that city. He was a man of ready wit
and racy humor, who delighted in preaching over a
bottle to his ungodly companions. He went to hear
Whitefield, that he might be furnished with matter for
a "tavern harangue." When he had heard enough of
the sermon for his purpose, he endeavored to quit the
church for the inn, but "found his endeavors to get
out fruitless, he was so pent up." While thus fixed,
and waiting for "fresh matter of ridicule," the truth
took possession of his heart. That night he went to
Mr. Prince full of terror, and sought an introduction
to ask pardon of the preacher. Whitefield says of
him, "By the paleness, pensiveness, and horror of his
countenance, I guessed he was the man of whom I had
been apprized. 'Sir, can you forgive me?' he cried
in a low, but plaintive voice. I smiled, and said, 'Yes,
sir, very readily.' 'Indeed,' he said, 'you cannot when
I tell you all.' I then asked him to sit down; and
judging that he had sufficiently felt the lash of the
law, I preached the gospel to him." This, with other
remarkable conversions, gave increasing energy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
influence to his preaching in Boston. "My bodily
strength," he says, "is recovered, and my soul more
than ever in love with a crucified Jesus."</p>

<p>Another illustration may also be here given of the
meekness and gentleness which usually characterized
our evangelist in his intercourse with his brethren.
In his later visits to New England, it was Whitefield's
usual practice to spend a few days with Dr. Hopkins.
On one of these occasions, after preaching for the doctor
on the Sabbath, the next day he proposed a ride
into the country for exercise. During the ride, Whitefield
spoke with regret of the views of their "good
brother Edwards on the subject of the witness of the
Holy Spirit." "Ah," asked Dr. Hopkins, "and what
is the error?" Here Whitefield made a long pause;
and Hopkins continued the conversation: "Do you
believe, Mr. Whitefield, that the witness of the Spirit
is a direct communication from God?" "I cannot say
that I do," was the reply. "Well, do you believe
that Christians have any other witness of the Spirit
than that afforded by the testimony of their own holy
affections?" "I cannot say that I do," Mr. Whitefield
again replied. "Do you believe it to be any
thing more or less," continued Hopkins, "than the
Spirit producing in the heart the gracious exercises
of repentance, faith, etc.?" "No, that is precisely my
view of it," said Whitefield. "And that is precisely
the view of good father Edwards," pleasantly returned
Dr. Hopkins. Whitefield frankly acknowledged
his error, and rejoiced that there was no disagreement
on the subject.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>FROM HIS LEAVING NEW ENGLAND TILL HIS ARRIVAL
IN ENGLAND&mdash;LABORS IN THE MIDDLE AND
SOUTHERN STATES&mdash;THE BERMUDAS.<br />

1745-1748.</h3></blockquote>


<p>Leaving New England, Whitefield proceeded first
to New York, where he preached as he had formerly
done, and found that the seed sown in past days had
produced much fruit. Proceeding still southward, on
his way towards Philadelphia, arriving in New Jersey,
he says, "I had the pleasure of preaching by an interpreter
to some converted Indians, and of seeing nearly
fifty young ones in one school, near Freehold, learning
the Assembly's Catechism." A blessed awakening
had before this time been begun and carried on among
the Delaware Indians, by the ministry of David Brainerd;
no such work had been heard of since the days
of the apostolic Eliot in New England.</p>

<p>Arriving in Philadelphia, Whitefield was rejoiced
to find that his friend Gilbert Tennent was still blessed
with success in his labors. Many, he says, were under
"soul-sickness," and Tennent's health suffered
much with walking from place to place to see them.
The gentlemen connected with the new house in which
Tennent preached, were, as well as Tennent himself,
desirous of securing at least a portion of Whitefield's
labors, and offered him eight hundred pounds a year,
if he would become their pastor, and labor with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
six months in the year, travelling the other six months
wherever he thought proper. He thanked them, but
declined.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently have we been told by frigid critics
of the inferior character of Whitefield's printed
sermons. But have they not looked too much for the
beauties of style, and overlooked the simple energy of
their scriptural truths? Even these printed sermons
have, under God, accomplished wonders. In the year
1743, a young gentleman from Scotland, then residing
at Hanover, in Virginia, had obtained a volume of
Whitefield's sermons preached in Glasgow, and taken
in shorthand, which, after a gentleman of Hanover,
named Hunt, the father of a distinguished Presbyterian
minister of that name, had studied with great
personal benefit, he invited his neighbors to visit his
house to hear read. By their plainness and fervor,
attended with the power of God, not a few became
convinced of their lost condition as sinners, and anxiously
inquired the way of salvation. The feelings of
many were powerfully excited, and they could not forbear
bitter and violent weeping. The intelligence
spread, curiosity prompted the desire of many others
to attend such remarkable services; and one and
another begged for admission, till the houses were
crowded. Numbers were pricked to the heart; the
word of God became quick and powerful; and, "What
shall we do?" was the general cry. What to do or
say the principal leaders knew not. They themselves
had been led by a still small voice, they hardly knew
how, to an acquaintance with the truth; but now the
Lord was speaking as on mount Sinai, with a voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
thunder; and sinners, like that mountain itself, trembled.
It was not long before Christians had the happiness
to see a goodly number healed by the same
word that had wounded them, and brought to rejoice
in Christ, and his great salvation. "My dwelling-place,"
said Mr. Morris, one of their number, "was
at length too small to contain the people, whereupon
we determined to build a meeting-house merely
for <em>reading</em>. And having never been used to social
prayer, none of us durst attempt it." This <em>reading-house</em>,
as it was called, was followed by others of
like character, and the number of attendants and the
power of divine influence were much increased. Mr.
Morris, as the report spread, was invited to several
places at a distance to read these sermons. The
phrase, "Morris' reading-house," has come down by
tradition to the present age, as well as important
details of the opposition of the magistracy and other
classes, who sought, but in vain, to stop the progress
of the work.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of the Presbyterian church at
Hanover, where, in after-days, William Robinson and
President Davies accomplished such mighty triumphs,
and where the sacred cause still flourishes.</p>

<p>Whitefield does not seem to have been made
acquainted with these facts till he now arrived in the
colony, and saw the happy effects which had been produced
by the labors of the Rev. Messrs. Robinson,
Tennent, Blair, and others. Of the visit of Whitefield
among them, one of them writes, "Mr. Whitefield
came and preached four or five days in these parts,
which was the happy means of giving us further encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and engaging others to the Lord, especially
among the church people, who received his doctrine
more readily than they would from ministers of
the Presbyterian denomination." We may add here,
that in 1747 there were four houses of worship in and
around Hanover, which had sprung from the "mustard-seed"
of the sermons taken in shorthand from Whitefield's
lips at Glasgow.</p>

<p>Among the converts in the south who met Whitefield,
was Isaac Oliver, who was both deaf and dumb,
and had been so from his birth. Notwithstanding
these great disadvantages, he could both feel and
evince his strong feelings by the most significant and
expressive signs. He could, for instance, so represent
the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ, as to be understood
by every one; and among his own friends he
could converse about the love of Christ in the language
of signs, till he was transported in rapture and
dissolved in tears. He was much beloved for his
eminent piety.</p>

<p>Whitefield had not, during any portion of this
time, forgotten Bethesda. The public had warmly
sustained it, and he now went forward to see to its
affairs, and to add to the orphan-house a Latin school,
intending, indeed, before a long time to found a college.</p>

<p>The following account of the orphan-house in
1746, was written by Mr. Whitefield in the form of a
letter to a friend, and published as a small pamphlet.
We transcribe it from "White's Historical Collections
of Georgia," published in 1854:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
"Provide things honest in the sight of all men."&mdash;Rom. 12:17.</p>
<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bethesda</span>, in Georgia, March 21, 1745-6.
</p>

<p>"Some have thought that the erecting such a
building was only the produce of my own brain; but
they are much mistaken; for it was first proposed to
me by my dear friend the Rev. Mr. Charles Wesley,
who, with his excellency General Oglethorpe, had concerted
a scheme for carrying on such a design before
I had any thoughts of going abroad myself. It was
natural to think that, as the government intended this
province for the refuge and support of many of our
poor countrymen, numbers of such adventurers must
necessarily be taken off, by being exposed to the hardships
which unavoidably attend a new settlement. I
thought it, therefore, a noble design in the general to
erect a house for fatherless children; and believing
that such a provision for orphans would be some
inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the
design, when mentioned to me by my friend, and was
resolved, in the strength of God, to prosecute it with
all my might. This was mentioned to the honorable
trustees. They took it kindly at my hands, and
wrote to the bishop of Bath and Wells for leave for
me to preach a charity sermon on this occasion in the
Abbey church. This was granted, and I accordingly
began immediately to compose a suitable discourse.
But knowing that my first stay in Georgia would
necessarily be short, on account of my returning again
to take priest's orders, I thought it most prudent first
to go and see for myself, and defer prosecuting the
scheme till I came home.... When I came to Georgia,
I found many poor orphans, who, though taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
notice of by the honorable trustees, yet, through the
neglect of persons under them, were in miserable circumstances.
For want of a house to bring them up
in, the poor little ones were tabled out here and there;
others were at hard services, and likely to have no
education at all.</p>

<p>"Upon seeing this, and finding that his Majesty
and Parliament had the interest of the colony much at
heart, I thought I could not better show my regard to
God and my country than by getting a house and land
for these children, where they might learn to labor,
read, and write, and at the same time be brought up
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Accordingly,
at my return to England, in the year 1738, to
take priest's orders, I applied to the honorable society
for a grant of five hundred acres of land, and laid
myself under an obligation to build a house upon it,
and to receive from time to time as many orphans as
the land and stock would maintain. As I had always
acted like a clergyman of the church of England, having
preached in a good part of the London churches,
and but a few months before collected near a thousand
pounds sterling for the children belonging to the
charity schools in London and Westminster, it was
natural to think that I might now have the use at
least of some of these churches to preach in for the
orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed
to my care. But by the time I had taken priest's
orders, the spirit of the clergy began to be much imbittered.
Churches were gradually denied me, and I
must let this good design drop, and thousands, and I
might add ten thousands, go without hearing the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of God, or preach in the fields. Indeed, two churches,
one in London, namely, Spitalfields, and one in Bristol,
namely, St. Philip's and Jacob, were lent me on
this occasion, but those were all. I collected for the
orphan-house in Moorfields two hundred and fifty
pounds one Sabbath-day morning, twenty-two pounds
of which were in copper. In the afternoon I collected
again at Kennington Common, and continued to do
so at most of the places where I preached. Besides
this, two or three of the bishops, and several persons
of distinction contributed, until at length, having gotten
about a thousand and ten pounds, I gave over
collecting, and went with what I had to Georgia. At
that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I
chose to take over only a surgeon and a few more of
both sexes, that I thought would be useful in carrying
on my design. My dear fellow-traveller William
Seward, Esq., also joined with them. Our first voyage
was to Philadelphia, where I was willing to go
for the sake of laying in provision. I laid out in
London a good part of the thousand pounds for goods,
and got as much by them in Philadelphia as nearly
defrayed the families' expenses of coming over. Here
God blessed my ministry daily....</p>

<p>"January following, 1739, I met my family at
Georgia, and being unwilling to lose any time, I hired
a large house, and took in all the orphans I could find
in the colony. A great many also of the town's children
came to school gratis, and many poor people
that could not maintain their children, upon application,
had leave given them to send their little ones
for a month or two, or more as they could spare them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
till at length my family consisted of between sixty
and seventy. Most of the orphans were in poor case,
and three or four almost eaten up with lice. I likewise
erected an infirmary, in which many sick people
were cured and taken care of gratis. I have now by
me a list of upwards of a hundred and thirty patients,
which were under the surgeon's hands, exclusive
of my own private family. About March I began
the great house, having only about one hundred and
fifty pounds in cash. I called it <em>Bethesda</em>, because I
hoped it would be a house of mercy to many souls.
Many boys have been put out to trades, and many
girls put out to service. I had the pleasure, the other
day, to see three boys work at the house in which
they were bred, one of them out of his time, a journeyman,
and the others serving under their masters.
One that I brought from New England is handsomely
settled in Carolina; and another from Philadelphia
is married, and lives very comfortably in
Savannah. We have lately begun to use the plough,
and next year I hope to have many acres of good
oats and barley. We have nearly twenty sheep and
lambs, fifty head of cattle, and seven horses. We
hope to kill a thousand weight of pork this season.
Our garden is very beautiful, furnishes us with all
sorts of greens, etc., etc. We have plenty of milk,
eggs, poultry, and make a good deal of butter weekly.
A good quantity of wool and cotton have been given
me, and we hope to have sufficient spun and wove for
the next winter's clothing. The family now consists
of twenty-six persons. Two of the orphan boys are
blind, one is little better than an idiot. I have two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
women to take care of the household work, and two
men and three boys employed about the plantation
and cattle. A set of Dutch servants has been
lately sent over. The magistrates were pleased to
give me two; and I took in a poor widow, aged near
seventy, whom nobody else cared to have. A valuable
young man from New England is my schoolmaster,
and in my absence performs duty in the family.
On Sabbaths, the grown people attend on public worship
at Savannah, or at White Bluff, a village near
Bethesda, where a Dutch minister officiates. The
house is a noble, commodious building, and every
thing sweetly adapted for bringing up youth. Georgia
is very healthy; not above one, and that a little
child, has died out of our family since it removed to
Bethesda."</p>

<p>A tabular statement follows this account, giving
full particulars of the eighty-six children who to that
period had been admitted into the establishment.</p>

<p>Old newspapers, as daguerreotyping the facts, and
even the feelings of any particular period, are sometimes
invaluable. In New York, as everywhere
else, Whitefield had his enemies, and many charges
were brought against him. But that there were those
who took a strongly favorable view of his character
and conduct, is very clear from an extract we give
from "The New York Post-Boy," of April, 1746:
"Mr. Whitefield's excellent parts, fine elocution, and
masterly address; his admirable talent of opening the
Scriptures, and enforcing the most weighty subjects
upon the conscience; his polite and serious behavior,
his unaffected and superior piety, his prudence, humility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and catholic spirit, are things which must silence
and disarm prejudice itself. By these qualifications
of the orator, the divine, and the Christian, he has
not only fixed himself deeper in the affections of his
former friends, but greatly increased the number
wherever he has preached; and made his way into
the hearts of several who, till this visit, had said all
the severe things against him that enmity itself seemed
capable of."</p>

<p>From this period, this paper especially noticed
the various movements of this apostolic man; his arrivals
in the city, his engagements in it, his departures
from it, and the places of his destination, were
all given with the minuti&#230; with which even the movements
of monarchs are recorded.</p>

<p>It was not without its use that the organs of the
public thus expressed their high sense of his character.
In 1745, suspicions were whispered abroad as
to the entire integrity of this excellent man in the
appropriation of the funds collected for Bethesda.
But happily for all parties, the magistrates of Savannah
published in the Philadelphia Gazette an affidavit,
that they had carefully examined Mr. Whitefield's
receipts and disbursements, and found that what he
had collected in behalf of the orphans, had been honestly
applied, and that besides, he had given considerably
to them of his own property.</p>

<p>Having done what he could at Bethesda, feeling
his health failing him, needing resources for his orphans,
and urged on by his love of preaching, Whitefield
was soon again in the field, far away from his
home. In the autumn of 1746, we find many passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in his journals and letters like these, while in Maryland:
"I trust the time for favoring this and the neighboring
southern provinces is come. Everywhere,
almost, the door is opened for preaching, great numbers
flock to hear, and the power of an ascended
Saviour attends the word. For it is surprising how
the Lord causes prejudices to subside, and makes my
former most bitter enemies to be at peace with me....
Lately I have been in seven counties in Maryland,
and preached with abundant success." At Charleston,
South Carolina, he writes, January 1747, "The
Lord Jesus is pleased to give me great access to multitudes
of souls." A few weeks later, he writes from
the same place, that Bethesda was never in a better
condition; that he had opened a Latin school there
during the winter, and that he hoped yet to see ministers
furnished from Georgia.</p>

<p>In April, we again find him in Maryland, as he
writes on the twenty-fifth of that month from Bohemia,
in that province, and speaks of the success of Mr. Samuel,
afterwards President Davies, in Virginia, but
adds that a proclamation had been issued in that state
against itinerants, so that he himself was shut out of
it. In the middle of May he exults, "Maryland is
yielding converts to the blessed Jesus. The gospel
seems to be moving southward. The harvest is promising.
The time of the singing birds is come;" and
five days afterwards he says, "I have been now a three
hundred miles' circuit in Maryland, and through one
or two counties in Pennsylvania. Everywhere the
people have a hearing ear, and I trust some have an
obedient heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first of June we find him in Philadelphia,
from whence he writes, "At present I have full work
here. The congregations yesterday were large, and
for this month past I have been preaching to thousands
in different places." During the whole of this month
his health was in a very critical state. Here we have
a few sentences from his pen, as given on different
days: "I am sick and well, as I used to be in England;
but the Redeemer fills me with comfort. I am
determined, in his strength, to die fighting.... I
have almost a continual burning fever. With great
regret I have omitted preaching <em>one</em> night to oblige
my friends, and purpose to do so once more, that they
may not charge me with murdering myself. But I
hope yet to die in the pulpit, or soon after I come out
of it.... Since my last, I have been several times
on the verge of eternity. At present I am so weak
that I cannot preach. It is hard work to be silent,
but I must be tried every way."</p>

<p>Sickness did not interrupt Whitefield's labors, if
he could move or preach at all. "I am determined,"
he says to Gilbert Tennent, "to die fighting, though
it be on my <em>stumps</em>." He was soon after at New York,
Newport, Portsmouth, and Boston. At New York
he writes, "I am as willing to hunt for souls as ever.
I am not weary of my work." On the next day he
writes, "I have preached to a very large auditory,
and do not find myself much worse for it." He did
so again with success. He then says, "I shall go to
Boston like an arrow out of a bow, if Jesus strengthen
me. I am resolved to preach and work for Him
until I can preach and work no more. I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
upon the water three or four days, and now eat like
a sailor." He went on to Boston, where he heard of
the sudden but joyful death of his venerable and excellent
friend Dr. Colman. He adds, "My reception
at Boston and elsewhere was like unto the first. Arrows
of conviction fled and stuck fast. Congregations
were larger than ever, and opposers' mouths
were stopped."</p>

<p>After again making short visits to Philadelphia
and Bohemia, Whitefield, according to previous arrangements,
went to spend the winter in North Carolina.
Before he left Bohemia, however, he wrote to
his friends at New York, who were intensely anxious
about his health, but he could only say it was yet
fluctuating. Even so was it when he arrived in North
Carolina, yet he writes, "I am here, hunting in the
woods, these <em>ungospelized</em> wilds, for sinners. It is
pleasant work, though my body is weak and crazy.
But after a short <em>fermentation</em> in the grave, it will be
fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body. The
thought of this rejoices my soul, and makes me long
to <em>leap</em> my seventy years. I sometimes think all will
go to heaven before me. Pray for me as a dying
man; but Oh, pray that I may not go off as a <em>snuff</em>.
I would fain die <em>blazing</em>&mdash;not with human glory, but
with the love of Jesus."</p>

<p>Such was his weakness, that his journey to Bathtown,
in North Carolina, was long and slow. Even
a short ride was fatiguing and painful. Still, he preached
with considerable power; cheered on from stage
to stage by the hope that the conversion of "North
Carolina sinners would be glad news in heaven." His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
letters indicated lively hopes of an extensive revival,
but his expectations were not fully realized. His
health was still exceedingly feeble, and his physicians
ordered him to try a change of climate. He accordingly
embarked for the Bermudas, where he landed,
March 15, 1748.</p>

<p>The Bermudas are a group of four small islands
lying about nine hundred miles east of Georgia. The
largest of the islands is called St. George's, with a
capital of the same name; the climate is remarkably
fine, and well adapted for the temporary residence
and recovery of invalids. Here Whitefield met with
an exceedingly kind reception, and remained on the
island with great benefit to his health, more than a
month. We scarcely need to say that he was not idle
during his residence here, but traversed the island
from one end to the other, generally preaching twice
a day. A few passages from his journal will best
show the facts.</p>

<p>"The simplicity and plainness of the people, together
with the pleasant situation of the island, much delighted
me. The Rev. Mr. Holiday, minister of Spanish
Point, received me in a most affectionate, Christian
manner; and begged I would make his house my
home. In the evening, I expounded at the house of
Mr. Savage, at Port Royal, which was very commodious;
and which also he would have me make my
home. I went with Mr. Savage in a boat to the town
of St. George, in order to pay our respects to the
governor. All along we had a most pleasant prospect
of the other part of the island; a more pleasant one I
never saw. Mrs. Smith, of St. George, for whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
had a letter of recommendation from my dear old
friend Mr. Smith, of Charlestown, received me into
her house. About noon, with one of the council and
Mr. Savage, I waited upon the governor. He received
us courteously, and invited us to dine with him and
the council. We accepted the invitation, and all behaved
with great civility and respect. After the governor
rose from the table, he desired, if I stayed in
town on the Sunday, that I would dine with him at
his own house.</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 20. Read prayers and preached
twice this day, to what were esteemed here large
auditories&mdash;in the morning at Spanish Point church,
and in the evening at Brackish Pond church, about
two miles distant from each other. In the afternoon
I spoke with greater freedom than in the morning,
and I trust not altogether in vain. All were attentive,
some wept. I dined with Colonel Butterfield,
one of the council; and received several invitations
to other gentlemen's houses. May God bless and
reward them, and incline them to open their hearts to
receive the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, March 23. Dined with Captain
Gibbs, and went from thence and expounded at the
house of Captain F&mdash;&mdash;le, at Hunbay, about two miles
distant. The company here also was large, attentive,
and affected. Our Lord gave me utterance. I expounded
the first part of the eighth chapter of Jeremiah.
After lecture, Mr. Riddle, a counsellor, invited me to
his house; as did Mr. Paul, an aged Presbyterian minister,
to his pulpit; which I complied with upon condition
that the rumor was true, that the governor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
served the ministers with an injunction that I should
not preach in the churches.</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 27. Glory be to God! I hope
this has been a profitable Sabbath to many souls; it
has been a pleasant one to mine. Both morning and
afternoon I preached to a large auditory, for the Bermudas,
in Mr. Paul's meeting-house, which I suppose
contains about four hundred. Abundance of negroes,
and many others, were in the porch, and about the
house. The word seemed to be clothed with a convincing
power, and to make its way into the hearts
of the hearers. Between sermons, I was entertained
very civilly in a neighboring house. Judge Bascom,
and three more of the council, came thither, and each
gave me an invitation to his house. How does the
Lord make way for a poor stranger in a strange land.
After the second sermon I dined with Mr. Paul; and
in the evening expounded to a very large company at
Councillor Riddle's. My body was somewhat weak;
but the Lord carried me through, and caused me to go
to rest rejoicing. May I thus go to my grave, when
my ceaseless and uninterrupted rest shall begin.</p>

<p>"Thursday, March 31. Dined on Tuesday at Colonel
Corbusier's, and on Wednesday at Colonel Gilbert's,
both of the council; and found, by what I
could hear, that some good had been done, and many
prejudices removed. Who shall hinder, if God will
work? Went to an island this afternoon called
Ireland, upon which live a few families; and to my
surprise, found a great many gentlemen, and other
people, with my friend Mr. Holiday, who came from
different quarters to hear me. Before I began preaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
I went round to see a most remarkable cave, which
very much displayed the exquisite workmanship of
Him, who in 'his strength setteth fast the mountains,
and is girded about with power.' While I was in the
cave, quite unexpectedly I turned and saw Councillor
Riddle, who, with his son, came to hear me; and
while we were in the boat, told me that he had been
with the governor, who declared he had no personal
prejudice against me, and wondered I did not come to
town and preach there, for it was the desire of the
people; and that any house in the town, the court-house
not excepted, should be at my service. Thanks
be to God for so much favor. If his cause requires
it, I shall have more. He knows my heart; I value
the favor of man no farther than as it makes room for
the gospel, and gives me a larger scope to promote
the glory of God. There being no capacious house
upon the island, I preached for the first time here in
the open air. All heard very attentively; and it was
very pleasant, after sermon, to see so many boats full
of people returning from the worship of God. I talked
seriously to some in our own boat, and sung a psalm,
in which they readily joined.</p>

<p>"Sunday, April 3. Preached twice this day at
Mr. Paul's meeting-house, as on the last Sabbath, but
with greater freedom and power, especially in the
morning; and I think to as great, if not greater auditories.
Dined with Colonel Harvy, another of the
council; visited a sick woman, where many came to
hear; and expounded afterwards to a great company,
at Captain John Dorrel's, Mrs. Dorrel's son, who with
his wife courteously entertained me, and desired me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to make his house my home. So true is that promise
of our Lord, that 'whosoever leaves father or mother,
houses or lands, shall have in this life a hundred-fold
with persecution, and in the world to come, life everlasting.'
Lord, I have experienced the one; in thy
good time grant that I may experience the other also.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, April 6. Preached yesterday at the
house of Mr. Anthony Smith, of Baylis Bay, with a
considerable degree of warmth; and rode afterwards
to St. George, the only town on the island. The
gentlemen of the town had sent me an invitation by
Judge Bascom; and he, with several others, came to
visit me at my lodgings; and informed me that the
governor desired to see me. About ten I waited upon
his excellency, who received me with great civility,
and told me he had no objection against my person or
my principles, having never yet heard me; and he
knew nothing with respect to my conduct in moral
life, that might prejudice him against me; but his
intentions were to let none preach in the island, unless
he had a written license to preach somewhere in
America, or the West Indies; at the same time he
acknowledged that it was but a matter of mere form.
I informed his excellency that I had been regularly
inducted into the parish of Savannah; that I was ordained
priest by letters dismissory from my lord of
London, and was under no church censure from his
lordship; and would always read the church prayers,
if the clergy would give me the use of their churches.
I added farther, that a minister's pulpit was always
looked upon as his freehold; and that I knew one
clergyman who had denied his own diocesan the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of his pulpit. But I told his excellency I was satisfied
with the liberty he allowed me, and would not
act contrary to his injunction. I then begged leave
to be dismissed, as I was obliged to preach at eleven
o'clock. His excellency said he intended to do himself
the pleasure to hear me. At eleven, the church bell
rung. The church Bible, prayer-book, and cushion,
were sent to the town-house. The governor, several
of the council, the minister of the parish, and assembly-men,
with a great number of the town's people,
assembled in great order. I was very sick, through
a cold I caught last night; but read the church prayers.
The first lesson was the fifteenth chapter of the
first book of Samuel. I preached on those words,
'Righteousness exalteth a nation.' Being weak and
faint, and afflicted much with the headache, I did not
do that justice to my subject which I sometimes am
enabled to do; but the Lord so helped me that, as I
found afterwards, the governor and the other gentlemen
expressed their approbation, and acknowledged
they did not expect to be so well entertained. Not
unto me, Lord, not unto me, but to thy free grace
be all the glory!</p>

<p>"After sermon, Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;bs, and Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;t, the
collector, came to me, and desired me to favor them
and the gentlemen of the town with my company at
dinner. I accepted the invitation. The governor,
and the president, and Judge Bascom were there.
All wondered at my speaking so freely and fluently
without notes. The governor asked whether I used
minutes. I answered, 'No.' He said it was a great
gift. At table, his excellency introduced something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of religion by asking me the meaning of the word
<span class="smcap">Hades</span>. Several other things were started about freewill,
Adam's fall, predestination, etc., to all which God
enabled me to answer so pertinently, and taught me
to mix the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utile</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulce</i> [useful and pleasant] so together,
that all at table seemed highly pleased, shook
me by the hand, and invited me to their respective
houses. The governor, in particular, asked me to
dine with him on the morrow; and Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;, one
of his particular intimates, invited me to drink tea in
the afternoon. I thanked all, returned proper respects,
and went to my lodgings with some degree of
thankfulness for the assistance vouchsafed me, and
abased before God at the consideration of my unspeakable
unworthiness. In the afternoon, about five
o'clock, I expounded the parable of the prodigal son
to many people at a private house; and in the evening
had liberty to speak freely and closely to those
who supped with me. O that this may be the beginning
of good gospel times to the inhabitants of this
town."</p>

<p>We might fill other pages from Whitefield's journal,
but will only give two more passages. The first
will show him in connection with the African race, in
whose highest welfare he always took a special
interest.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 7. In my conversation these two
days with some of my friends, I was diverted much
in hearing several things that passed among the poor
negroes, since I preached to them last Sunday. One
of the women, it seems, said that 'if the book I preached
out of was the best book that was ever bought at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
London, she was sure it had never all that in it which
I spoke to the negroes,' The old man who spoke out
loud last Sunday, and said 'yes' when I asked them
whether all the negroes would not go to heaven, being
questioned by somebody why he spoke out so, answered,
that 'the gentleman put the question once or twice
to them, and the other fools had not the manners to
make any answer; till at last I seemed to point at
him, and he was ashamed that nobody should answer
me, and therefore he did.' Another, wondering why
I said negroes had black hearts, was answered by his
black brother, 'Ah, thou fool, dost not thou understand
it? He means black with sin.' Two girls
were overheard by their mistress talking about religion,
and they said 'they knew, if they did not repent,
they must be damned.' From all which I infer that
these negroes on the Bermudas are more awake than
I supposed; that their consciences are awake, and
consequently prepared in a good measure for hearing
the gospel preached to them."</p>

<p>Whitefield sums up the events which had occurred
in connection with himself on the Bermudas, the
praise of which islands has also been celebrated by
the distinguished Bishop Berkeley, who resided there
for some time, and by Waller the poet.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 22. Blessed be God, the little
leaven thrown into the three measures of meal begins
to ferment and work almost every day for the week
past. I have conversed with souls loaded with a
sense of their sins, and as far as I can judge, really
pricked to the heart. I preached only three times,
but to almost three times larger auditories than usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Indeed, the fields are white, ready to harvest. God
has been pleased to bless private visits. Go where I
will, upon the least notice, houses are crowded, and
the poor souls that follow are soon drenched in tears.
This day I took, as it were, another farewell. As the
ship did not sail, I preached at Somerset in the morning
to a large congregation in the fields; and expounded
in the evening at Mr. Harvy's house, around
which stood many hundreds of people. But in the
morning and evening how did the poor souls weep.
Abundance of prayers and blessings were put up for
my safe passage to England, and speedy return to the
Bermudas again. May they enter into the ears of the
Lord of sabaoth. With all humility and thankfulness
of heart will I here, O Lord, set up my <em>Ebenezer</em>,
for hitherto surely hast thou helped me. Thanks be
to the Lord for sending me hither. I have been received
in a manner I dared not to expect, and have
met with little, very little opposition indeed. The
inhabitants seem to be plain and open-hearted. They
have loaded me with provisions for my sea-store; and
in the several parishes, by a private voluntary contribution,
have raised me upwards of <em>one hundred pounds
sterling</em>. This will pay a little of Bethesda's debt,
and enable me to make such a remittance to my dear
yoke-fellow, as may keep her from being embarrassed,
or too much beholden in my absence. Blessed be
God for bringing me out of my embarrassments by
degrees. May the Lord reward all my benefactors a
thousand-fold. I hear that what was given, was given
heartily, and people only lamented that they could
do no more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield now transmitted to Georgia what had
been collected for the orphan-house; but fearing a
relapse, if he returned to the south during the hot
season, which was near commencing, and pressed also
again to visit England, he took his passage in a brig,
and in twenty-eight days arrived at Deal.</p>

<p>On his voyage, he completed an abridgment,
which he had previously begun, of "<cite>Law's serious Call
to a devout and holy Life</cite>," which he endeavored to
make more useful by excluding whatever is not truly
evangelical, and illustrating the subject more fully,
especially from the holy Scriptures. He also wrote
letters to his friends, one of which strikingly illustrates
his Christian humility. It bears date June 24,
1748. "Yesterday I made an end of revising all my
journals. Alas, alas, in how many things I have
judged and acted wrong. I have been too rash and
hasty in giving characters both of places and persons.
Being fond of Scripture language, I have used a style
too apostolical, and at the same time I have been too
bitter in my zeal. Wildfire has been mixed with it,
and I find that I frequently wrote and spoke in my
own spirit, when I thought I was writing and speaking
by the assistance of the Spirit of God. I have,
likewise, too much made inward impressions my rule
of acting, and too soon and too explicitly published
what had been better kept in longer, or told after my
death. By these things I have hurt the blessed cause
I would defend, and also stirred up a needless opposition.
This has humbled me much, and made me
think of a saying of Mr. Henry, 'Joseph had more
honesty than he had policy, or he never would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
told his dreams.' At the same time, I cannot but
praise God, who fills me with so much of his holy fire,
and carried me, a poor weak youth, through such a
torrent, both of popularity and contempt, and set so
many seals to my unworthy ministrations. I bless
him for ripening my judgment a little more, for giving
me to see and confess, and I hope in some degree to
correct and amend some of my former mistakes."</p>

<p>In the early part of this year, 1748, the "Gentleman's
Magazine" had announced Whitefield's death
as having taken place in America. One of his first
letters on his arrival at Deal in that year, says,
"Words cannot express how joyful my friends were
to see me once more in the land of the living, for I
find the newspapers had buried me ever since April
last. But it seems I am not to die, but live. O that
it may be to declare the works of the Lord."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>LABORS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND&mdash;CHAPLAIN
TO LADY HUNTINGDON.<br />

1748, 1749.</h3>


<p>On the evening of July 6, 1748, Whitefield again
found himself in London, after an absence of nearly
four years. Here he was welcomed with joy by many
thousands. The large church of St. Bartholomew was
at once thrown open to him, where multitudes flocked
to hear, and where on the first Sabbath he had a
thousand communicants. But in his own more immediate
circle many things were in an unhappy condition.
His congregation at the Tabernacle had been
much scattered during his absence; Antinomianism
had made sad havoc among the people; and one of
this party threatened to rival him in Moorfields.
Whitefield sent him word, "The fields are no doubt
as free to you as to another. God send you a clear
head and a <em>clean</em> heart. I intend preaching there on
Sunday evening." He did so; and found "Moorfields
as white to harvest as ever." Our evangelist
was again called to mourn the evils of poverty. He
found himself compelled to sell his household furniture,
to pay, in part, the debts of his orphan-house,
which were yet far from being cancelled; his aged
mother, for whom he always retained the highest
regard, also needed his aid. These and other trials
pressed him sorely; but on the other hand, he felt
happy in his work, and his congregation were soon
reunited, and happy in his labors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen that as early as 1738, Lady Huntingdon,
with his lordship her husband, as frequently
as they could, heard Whitefield preach; since that
period his lordship had died, leaving her ladyship a
widow, in the thirty-ninth year of her age. At what
period she became more openly and intimately Whitefield's
friend does not appear; but when he landed at
Deal from his third visit to America, she sent Howel
Harris to bring him to her house at Chelsea, where
he preached to large circles of the gay world, who
thronged this then fashionable watering-place. For
the benefit of this class of hearers, she soon after
removed to London, at that time some three miles
distant from Chelsea, appointed Whitefield her chaplain,
and during the winter of 1748 and '49, opened
her splendid mansion in Park-street for the preaching
of the gospel. "Good Lady Huntingdon," he writes,
"has come to town, and I am to preach twice a week
at her house to the great and noble. O that some of
them might be effectually called to taste the riches of
redeeming love." On the first day appointed, Chesterfield
and Bolingbroke, both of them well-known
for their gayety and infidelity, and a circle of the
nobility, attended; and having heard him once, they
desired to come again. "Lord Chesterfield thanked
me," he says. "Lord Bolingbroke was moved, and
asked me to come and see him the next morning. My
hands have been full of work, and I have been among
great company. All accepted my sermons. Thus the
world turns round. '<em>In all time of my wealth, good
Lord, deliver me.</em>'"</p>

<p>The death-bed of Lord St. John Bolingbroke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
whom we have already mentioned as one of his parlor-hearers,
exhibited scenes unusual in the circle where
he moved. The Bible was read to him, and his cry
was, "God be merciful to me a sinner." "My Lord
Bolingbroke," wrote Lady Huntingdon to Whitefield,
"was much struck with his brother's language in his
last moments. O that his eyes might be opened by
the illuminating influence of divine truth. He is a
singularly awful character; and I am fearfully alarmed,
lest the gospel which he so heartily despises, yet
affects to reverence, should prove the savor of death
unto death to him. Some, I trust, are savingly awakened,
while many are inquiring; thus the great Lord
of the harvest hath put honor on your ministry, and
hath given my heart an encouraging token of the utility
of our feeble efforts."</p>

<p>It is related that the Rev. Mr. Church, a clergyman
who died curate of Battersea, near London, one
day called on Bolingbroke, who said to him, "You
have caught me reading John Calvin; he was indeed
a man of great parts, profound sense, and vast learning;
he handles the doctrines of grace in a very masterly
manner." "Doctrines of grace," replied the
clergyman; "the doctrines of grace have set all mankind
by the ears." "I am surprised to hear you say
so," answered Lord Bolingbroke, "you who profess to
believe and to preach Christianity. Those doctrines
are certainly the doctrines of the Bible, and if I believe
the Bible I must believe them. And let me seriously
tell you, that the greatest miracle in the world
is the subsistence of Christianity, and its continued
preservation, as a religion, when the preaching of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
is committed to the care of such unchristian men as
you."</p>

<p>At this period Whitefield renewed his acquaintance
with the Rev. James Hervey, who has not improperly
been called the Melancthon of the second
reformation in England. Among all the converts of
our evangelist, no one was more distinguished for piety,
or for his fascination as a writer, than this admirable
clergyman. His writings, though too flowery in their
style, were eminently suitable, as Whitefield himself
says, "for the taste of the polite world." Hervey
wrote to Whitefield, "Your journals and sermons, and
especially that sweet sermon on 'What think ye of
Christ?' were a means of bringing me to the knowledge
of the truth." Whitefield felt the warmest
attachment to Hervey in return, and when he introduced
some of his works into America, wrote, "The
author is my old friend; a most heavenly-minded
creature; one of the first Methodists, who is contented
with a small <em>cure</em>, and gives all he has to the poor.
We correspond with, though we cannot see each
other." Whitefield intimated in one of his journals
his intention of sketching Hervey's character, but this
was one of the many intended things which were
never accomplished. Dr. Doddridge wrote a preface
to one of his works, which Warburton, as might be
expected, called "a weak rhapsody."</p>

<p>Under the auspices of Lady Huntingdon, a prayer-meeting
was established for the women who, from the
circles of rank and fashion, became the followers of
the Lord. Among these were Lady Frances Gardiner,
Lady Mary Hamilton, daughter of the Marquis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Lothian, who had attended the ministry of Whitefield
in Scotland, Lady Gertrude Hotham and Countess
Delitz, sisters of Lady Chesterfield, Lady Chesterfield
herself, and Lady Fanny Shirley. "Religion," says
Lady Huntingdon, when writing to Doddridge, "was
never so much the subject of conversation as now.
Some of the great ones hear with me the gospel patiently,
and thus much seed is sown by Mr. Whitefield's
preaching. O that it may fall on good ground,
and bring forth abundantly."</p>

<p>Some one, we believe a bishop, complained to
George II. of the popularity and success of Whitefield,
and entreated his majesty in some way or other
to silence him. The monarch, thinking, no doubt, of
the class described by the martyr Latimer, as "unpreaching
prelates," replied with jocose severity, "I
believe the best way will be to make a bishop of
him."</p>

<p>But if Whitefield was honored by some of the
great, he received from others unmingled hostility.
Horace Walpole, the gay man, and the corrupt courtier,
thought it worth while to introduce the Methodist
preacher into his "Private Correspondence." The
statement he makes of professed facts is altogether
incredible, but shows unmistakably the spirit of the
writer. "The apostle Whitefield is come to some
shame. He went to Lady Huntingdon lately, and
asked for forty pounds for some distressed saint or
other. She said she had not so much money in the
house, but would give it him the first time she had.
He was very pressing, but in vain. At last he said,
'There's your watch and trinkets, you don't want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
such vanities; I will have that.' She would have put
him off; but he persisting, she said, 'Well, if you must
have it, you must.' About a fortnight afterwards,
going to his house, and being carried into his wife's
chamber, among the paraphernalia of the latter the
countess found her own offering. This has made a
terrible schism; she tells the story herself. I had
not it from Saint Frances, [Lady Fanny Shirley,] but
I hope it is true." Every thing goes to prove the
sincerity of his hope, though founded on falsehood.</p>

<p>It has generally happened that the most effective
public speakers, whether secular or sacred, have been
accused by a fastidious class with <em>vulgarisms</em>. So with
Cicero, Burke, and Chatham; so with Patrick Henry
and Daniel Webster; and to turn to eminent preachers,
so with Luther, Latimer, and Whitefield. The
reason was, that intent on the greatest good to the
greatest number, they used what Dr. Johnson, after
Daniel Burgess, called "market language." Dr. William
Bates, an accomplished and courtly non-conformist
minister, in the seventeenth century, once complained
in the presence of his faithful but unpolished
friend Daniel Burgess, that he found very little success
in his work as a minister; when his aged brother
smartly replied, "Thank your velvet mouth for that&mdash;too
fine to speak market language." Whitefield, very
happily for thousands, had no squeamishness of this
sort.</p>

<p>Some ladies called one Saturday morning to pay a
visit to Lady Huntingdon, and during the interview,
her ladyship inquired of them if they had ever heard
Mr. Whitefield preach. On being answered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
negative, she said, "I wish you would hear him; he
is to preach to-morrow evening." They promised her
ladyship they would certainly attend. They fulfilled
their promise; and when they called on her ladyship
the next Monday morning, she anxiously inquired if
they had heard Mr. Whitefield on the previous evening,
and how they liked him. The reply was, "Oh,
my lady, of all the preachers we ever heard, he is the
most strange and unaccountable! Among other preposterous
things, would your ladyship believe it, he
declared that Jesus Christ was so willing to receive
sinners, that he did not object to receive even the
devil's <em>castaways</em>! Now, my lady, did you ever hear
of such a thing since you were born?" Her ladyship,
in reply, said, "There is something, I acknowledge, a
little singular in the invitation, and I do not recollect
to have met with it before; but as Mr. Whitefield is
below in the parlor, we will have him up, and let him
answer for himself."</p>

<p>On Mr. Whitefield's entering the drawing-room,
Lady Huntingdon said, "Sir, these ladies have been
preferring a very heavy charge against you, and I
thought it best that you should come up and defend
yourself. They say, that in your sermon last evening,
in speaking of the willingness of Jesus Christ to receive
sinners, you said, that 'so ready was Christ to
receive sinners who came to him, that he was willing
to receive even the devil's castaways.'" Mr. Whitefield
immediately replied, "I certainly, my lady, must
plead guilty to the charge; whether I did what was
right, or otherwise, your ladyship shall judge when
you have heard a fact. Did your ladyship notice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
about half an hour ago, a very modest single rap at
the door? It was given by a poor, miserable looking
aged female, who requested to speak with me. I desired
that she might be shown into the parlor, when
she thus addressed me: 'I believe, sir, you preached
last evening at such a chapel.' 'Yes, I did.' 'Ah,
sir, I was accidentally passing the door of that chapel,
and hearing the voice of some one preaching, I did
what I have never been in the habit of doing&mdash;I went
in; and one of the first things I heard you say, was,
that Jesus Christ was so willing to receive sinners,
that he did not object to receive the devil's castaways.
Do you think, sir, that Jesus Christ would receive me?'
I answered her that there was not a doubt of it, if she
was but willing to go to him."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to add, that the impression conveyed
in the singular language of Mr. Whitefield ended in
the conversion of the poor woman to God. She gave
satisfactory evidence that her great and numerous sins
had been forgiven through the atonement of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Was Mr. Whitefield to be censured for
the use of this language?</p>

<p>In September, 1748, Mr. Whitefield made his third
visit to Scotland, where he met with a cordial welcome,
and where his labors became increasingly valued.
Some of the clergy at Glasgow, Perth, and
Edinburgh used their influence to exclude him from
the pulpits, but the majority voted in his favor; and
a full examination vindicated his character, and made
his excellences more generally known. All the ministers
who were disposed to invite him to preach, were
at liberty to do so, except in the presbytery of Edinburgh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
here, however, he was accommodated by the
magistrates with a church to preach in whenever he
visited the city. In Scotland he now warmly advocated
the cause of the college in New Jersey: of the
results of his labors we shall hear more hereafter.</p>

<p>On his return to London, Whitefield resumed his
preaching at Lady Huntingdon's to "the great ones,"
as he calls them. Thirty, and sometimes even sixty
persons of rank attended, although the newspapers
gave false and degrading accounts of the reception he
met with in Scotland. He now availed himself of the
influence he possessed, to forward his intended college,
in addition to his orphan-house, for which his plea
was, "If some such thing be not done, I cannot see
how the southern parts will be provided with ministers;
for all are afraid to go over." On this ground
he appealed to the trustees of Georgia; reminding
them that he had expended five thousand pounds upon
the orphan-house; begging them to relieve it, as a
charitable institution, from all quit-rent and taxes;
and especially to allow him the labor of blacks in cultivating
the farm. "White hands," he said, "had left
his tract of land uncultivated."</p>

<p>It will not be expected that Whitefield could stay
long, even in the courtly circles of London, where he
met with so much acceptance. We very soon find him
among his old friends at Gloucester and Bristol. The
bishop of the latter see, he says, behaved very respectfully
to him; he visited also his old tutor, now become
one of the prebendaries, and met with the old
kindness received at Oxford. "I told him, that my
judgment, as I trust, was a little more ripened than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
was some years ago; and that as fast as I found out
my faults, I should be glad to acknowledge them.
He said the offence of the governors of the church
would wear off as I grew <em>moderate</em>." The evangelist
did not tell the doctor how little he cared for such
moderation as the governors of the church in that day
required; but he wrote to Lady Huntingdon, on the
subject of their favor, "I am pretty easy about that.
If I can but act an honest part, and be kept from
<em>trimming</em>, I leave all consequences to Him who orders
all things well." During this journey, many new converts
were won. One of these was a counsellor, who
was so much affected, that his zeal in inviting others
to hear Whitefield led his wife to suspect him of
madness.</p>

<p>An interesting fact connected with Gloucestershire,
his native county, may be introduced in this
place, though we are not sure that it occurred during
this journey. John Skinner of Houndscroft was a
strolling fiddler, going from fair to fair, supplying
music to any party that would hire him. Having
determined to interrupt Mr. Whitefield while preaching,
he obtained a standing on a ladder raised to a
window near the pulpit. Here he remained a quiet,
if not an attentive hearer, till the text was read, when
he intended to begin his annoying exercise on the violin.
It pleased God, however, while he was putting
his instrument in tune, to convey the word preached
with irresistible power to his soul; his attention was
diverted from his original purpose, he heard the whole
sermon, and became a new man.</p>

<p>Happily Whitefield was blessed in bringing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Christ many who were made eminently useful. Among
others we might mention the late Rev. Cornelius
Winter, an eminent minister, who afterwards accompanied
our evangelist in his last voyage to America,
and who after his death conveyed his will to England,
and sought ordination to return and labor in
Georgia. Disappointed in this, he became an able
and successful minister in England; and also trained
several young men for the Christian ministry, including
the late celebrated William Jay of Bath.
Whitefield had often been heard by Winter with
great pleasure, for he admired his eloquence; but for
some time no good effects were apparent. One night,
while playing at cards, an amusement in which he
much delighted, and though surrounded by a number
of gay companions, the thought presented itself to
Winter's mind that he might that evening hear his
favorite preacher. He broke off from play in the
midst of the game, which made his companions very
angry, as they suspected where he was going. He
tells us that it was a night much to be remembered.
He had reason to hope the scales of ignorance were
then removed from his eyes, he had a sense of his
misery as a sinner, and was led to earnest inquiry
after the way of salvation. It is scarcely necessary
to say, that he never again played at cards.</p>

<p>From the exhilarating scenes of Gloucestershire
and Bristol, we must accompany Whitefield into Cornwall,
among the glens and dales of which, or on
the seaside to a somewhat similar population and
with almost equal success, he spoke "all the words of
this life." The robust and determined miners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
west of England, whose very employment gives hardihood
alike to their character and frame, at first received
him in somewhat rough and unpolished style,
but were soon after melted and transformed by the
grace which had displayed its triumphs among their
brethren at Kingswood. "I am just returned," he
writes on one occasion, "from near the Land's End,
where thousands and thousands heard the gospel gladly.
Everywhere the word of God has run and been
glorified. Every day I have been travelling and
preaching; and could I stay a month, it might be
spent to great advantage. At a place called Port
Isaac, the Redeemer's stately steps were indeed seen.
At Camelford I preached with great quietness in the
streets. At St. Ann's we had a very powerful season;
and yesterday at Redruth several thousands attended,
and the word was quick and powerful." Again he
writes, "Immediately after writing my last, I preached
to many thousands at a place called Gwennap.
The rain descended, but the grace of God seemed to
fall like a gentle dew, sprinkling rain upon our souls.
It was indeed a fine spring shower. In the evening
I rode to St. Ives, and preached to many who gladly
attended to hear the word; a great power seemed to
accompany it. On the Lord's day I preached twice
to great auditories. On Monday I preached again at
Redruth, at ten in the morning, to nearly, as they
were computed, ten thousand souls. Arrows of conviction
seemed to fly fast." Again, in a communication
to the Countess of Huntingdon, he says, "I have
been very near the Land's End, and everywhere souls
have fled to hear the word preached, 'like doves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
their windows.' The harvest is great, yea, very great,
but laborers are few. O that the Lord of the harvest
would thrust out more laborers." And yet again he
says, "Invitations are sent to me from Falmouth and
several other places, but I cannot attend to them all
at present. I want more tongues, more bodies, more
souls, for the Lord Jesus. Had I ten thousand, he
should have them all." Such was the noble spirit he
displayed, and such were the manner and fruits of his
"entering in among" the, at that time, benighted children
of Cornwall. A great light shone upon them.
They came from the caverns of the earth to welcome
its rising, and to look upon its brightness. Thousands
of them were indeed "brought out of darkness into
marvellous light," and turned by it from sin to holiness,
and from Satan to God; and thousands are still
rejoicing in its beams.</p>

<p>On his return to London, Whitefield found his
assemblies at the countess's "brilliant indeed," and
Lord Bolingbroke still one among them. Of this talented
nobleman our evangelist at this time indulged
a happy hope, which, alas, seems never to have been
realized.</p>

<p>In February, 1749, Whitefield made an excursion
to Exeter and Plymouth, where he was agreeably surprised
to find a great alteration had taken place since
his preceding visit, five years before. He loved to
"range," as he called it, "after precious souls," and
happily for him and for others he found them. During
this and subsequent visits to Plymouth, he resided
with the Rev. Andrew Kinsman, an excellent Congregational
minister, of whom we have already spoken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
He was born in Devonshire in 1724, and was therefore
ten years younger than Whitefield. While peculiarly
amiable in his manners, and remarkable for his
regard to his parents, he was unacquainted with the
religion of the heart till his seventeenth year, when he
met with a volume of Mr. Whitefield's sermons, and
one of those on the new birth alarmed him. His
pious friends were few, but his religious feelings were
deeply moved, and God at length gave him "the oil
of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the
spirit of heaviness." Concerned for the highest interests
of his relatives, he one night, as the family were
retiring to rest, broke out, with intense emotion, "What,
shall we go to bed without prayer? How do we know
but some of us may awake in hell before morning?"
This unexpected address struck the family with solemn
awe; and while they looked at each other with conscious
shame, for the neglect of so clear a duty, he
fell upon his knees and prayed with so much readiness
and fervor that it excited their astonishment.</p>

<p>As might be expected, his concern for others did
not stop here; he was anxious that his neighbors
might also find "the unsearchable riches of Christ."
He began, therefore, to read Whitefield's sermons to
as many as would attend, supposing, with Melancthon,
that what had proved so great a blessing to himself,
would not fail of similar effects on others, as soon as
they were heard. After a short time, he began himself
to expound and preach, and was encouraged by
many conversions under his ministry, including those
of his father, mother, and three sisters. Not long
after these events, Whitefield, in entering on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
his voyages to America, had been compelled to stay
at Plymouth, where Kinsman first saw and heard him.
By a series of remarkable events, Mr. Kinsman was
brought to settle as a minister at Plymouth, where
the "Tabernacle" was erected on ground given by
himself, and the congregation were served by him and
other ministers with abundant success. In the whole
neighborhood an extraordinary blessing attended his
labors, and his usefulness and deliverances from danger
were only second to those of Whitefield himself.
Nor was he less respected, nor his ministry attended
with less success, at Bristol and London&mdash;cities to
which he was invited by Whitefield; who used to
call Bristol "<em>Kinsman's America</em>," alluding to his own
reception and success in the western world.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when Whitefield was about to
sail for America, he sent for Kinsman to London, and
on his arrival dined with his distinguished friend at
the Tabernacle house. After dinner there was a violent
storm of thunder and lightning. As they stood at
the window looking out on the raging elements, Mr.
Kinsman, supposing a young clergyman who had dined
with them, and who now stood by his side, to be a
pious man, familiarly put his hand on his shoulder,
and with great cheerfulness and energy repeated the
lines of Dr. Watts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The God who rules on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thunders when he please;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who rides upon the stormy sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And manages the seas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>This awful God is ours</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our Father, and our love!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>The words so appropriately introduced, and so
emphatically spoken, made a deep impression on the
mind of the young clergyman, and gave rise to a conversation
which, by the blessing of God, led to his
conversion.</p>

<p>At the Tabernacle in London, the ministry of Mr.
Kinsman was greatly distinguished for its excellence
and success, and he thought himself highly honored in
preaching the first sermon delivered from the pulpit
of the present Tabernacle. His musical voice, his
lively and pathetic address, and the richness of the
evangelical truths he proclaimed, brought numbers of
all classes of society to hear him. Among them was
Shuter, the comedian, to whom we shall again refer
as a hearer of Whitefield, and who years afterwards,
in an interview with Kinsman, drew a striking contrast
between their professions, and bitterly lamented
that he had not cordially embraced religion, when his
conscience was impressed under the preaching of the
great evangelist.</p>

<p>But we must not stay longer to speak of Kinsman;
suffice it to say that he founded, in addition to Plymouth,
a new church three miles from thence, at a place
now called Devonport, and labored with energy and
holy success till the sixty-ninth year of his age, when he
died in triumph, February 28, 1793. Of such a man
it was truly said, that for Whitefield "he retained the
most filial affection to his dying day; and frequently
travelled with, and consulted him as a father upon all
his religious concerns."</p>

<p>In March Whitefield returned to London, where
the feeble state of his health made him feel weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
even in his success. He says, "I have seen enough of
popularity to be sick of it, and did not the interest of
my blessed Master require my appearing in public,
the world should hear but little of me henceforward."
Yet his zeal abated not. "I dread the thoughts of
flagging in the latter stages of my road," is an expression
often used in his letters to his friends. He
thought that preaching and travelling contributed to
his health. In a letter to Hervey, he says, "Fear not
your weak body, we are immortal till our work is
done. Christ's laborers must live by miracle; if not,
I must not live at all, for God only knows what I
daily endure. My continual vomitings almost kill
me, and yet the pulpit is my cure; so that my friends
begin to pity me less, and to leave off that ungrateful
caution, 'Spare thyself.' I speak this to encourage
you."</p>

<p>All this Whitefield meant. Hence in May we find
him preaching at Portsmouth daily, for more than a
week, to very large and attentive auditories; where
was shown another remarkable instance of the power
which attended his preaching, for many who a few
days before were speaking all manner of evil against
him, were very desirous of his longer stay to preach
the gospel among them. From Bristol, June 24, he
writes, "Yesterday God brought me here, after a circuit
of about eight hundred miles, and enabled me to
preach to, I suppose, upwards of a hundred thousand
souls. I have been in eight Welsh counties, and I
think we have not had one dry meeting. The work
in Wales is much upon the advance, and likely to
increase daily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield returned to London to welcome his
wife home from the Bermuda Islands. From her he
learned that there his character had been aspersed by
one of the clergy; but while he grieved over the fact,
he said, "I am content to wait till the day of judgment
for the clearing up of my character; and after I am
dead, I desire no other epitaph than this, 'Here lies
George Whitefield. What sort of a man he was, the
great day will discover.'"</p>

<p>In the midst of his sorrows, Whitefield was comforted
by a visit from two German ministers, who had
been laboring among the Jews with apparently happy
results. He found also several of the peeresses, and
others of "the great," cordially disposed to receive
him; and shortly afterwards was visited by Mr. Grimshaw,
a clergyman from Yorkshire, for whom in September
he went to preach. Thousands in the village of
Haworth attended his preaching, even ten thousand at
a time, and a thousand communicants approached the
table of the Lord. At Leeds also he preached, at the
invitation of Mr. Wesley's people, to ten thousand
persons, and Mr. Charles Wesley himself introduced
him to the pulpit at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p>In the north of England the visits of Mr. Whitefield
were always looked for with intense interest. In
one of his letters, he thus describes the state of things
there in August, 1756: "It is now a fortnight since I
came to Leeds, in and about which I preached eight
days successively, three times almost every day, to
thronged and affected auditories. On Sunday last at
Bradford, in the morning, the audience consisted of
above ten thousand; at noon, and in the evening, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Birstal, of nearly double that number. Though hoarse,
I was able to speak so that they all heard." These
hallowed services were often spoken of by the late
Rev. Dr. John Fawcett, for more than half a century
an eminent Baptist minister of that neighborhood, to
whose soul they proved a rich blessing. After having
heard Whitefield at Bradford in the morning, he
followed him to Birstal, where a platform was erected
at the foot of a hill adjoining the town, whence Mr.
Whitefield addressed an immense concourse of people,
not fewer, it was believed, than twenty thousand, who
were ranged before him on the declivity in the form
of an amphitheatre. "I lay," says Fawcett, "under
the scaffold, and it appeared as if all his words were
addressed to me, and as if he had known my most
secret thoughts from ten years of age. As long as
life remains, I shall remember both the text and the
sermon." Accustomed as he was to preach to large
and promiscuous multitudes, when he looked on this
vast assemblage, and was about to mount the temporary
stage, he expressed to his surrounding friends a
considerable feeling of timidity; but when he began
to speak, an unusual solemnity pervaded the assembly,
and thousands, in the course of the sermon, as was
often the fact, gave vent to their emotions by tears
and groans. Fools who came to mock, began to pray,
and to cry out, "What must we do to be saved?"</p>

<p>Mr. Shirley, in giving an account of this same service,
tells us that "not only the field, but the woodlands
about it, were covered with crowds collected
from different parts. An unusual solemnity pervaded
this vast multitude, and at the close of the service the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
one hundredth psalm was sung, and concluded with
Mr. Grimshaw's favorite doxology,</p>

<p class="center">
"'Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.'
</p>

<div class="noindent">The volume of sound produced by the united voices
of thousands, while it re&#235;choed through the vale below,
had such an effect as no language can describe."</div>

<p>Mr. Grimshaw was a very remarkable clergyman
connected with the church of England, though found
fault with on account of his irregularity. He studied
at Cambridge for the ministry before he was acquainted
with the reality of true religion. His conversion
was very striking; after which he became a remarkably
faithful and pungent preacher. He settled at
Haworth, in Yorkshire, where Mr. Whitefield visited
him.</p>

<p>In one of the services held by Mr. Whitefield in
Yorkshire, a deep solemnity was created by providential
circumstances. He had mounted the temporary
scaffold to address the thousands before him. Casting
a look over the multitude, he elevated his hands,
and in an energetic manner implored the divine presence
and blessing. With a solemnity peculiarly his
own, he then announced his text, "It is appointed
unto men once to die, but after this the judgment."
Heb. 11:27. After a short pause, as he was about
to proceed, a wild, terrifying shriek issued from the
centre of the congregation. A momentary alarm and
confusion ensued. Mr. Whitefield waited to ascertain
the cause, and requested the people to remain still.
Mr. Grimshaw hurried to the spot, and in a few minutes
was seen pressing towards the place where Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Whitefield stood. "Brother Whitefield," said he,
manifesting in the strongest manner the intensity of
his feelings, and the ardor of his concern for the salvation
of sinners, "you stand among the dead and the
dying. An immortal soul has been called into eternity;
the destroying angel is passing over the congregation;
cry aloud, and spare not." The awful
occurrence was speedily announced to the congregation.
After the lapse of a few moments, Mr. Whitefield
again announced his text. Again a loud and
piercing shriek proceeded from the spot near where
Lady Huntingdon and Lady Margaret Ingham were
standing. A thrill of horror seemed to escape from
the multitude when it was understood that a <em>second</em>
person had fallen a victim to the king of terrors.
When the consternation had somewhat subsided, Mr.
Whitefield gave indications of proceeding with the
service. The excited feelings of many were wound up
to their highest point. All was hushed; not a sound
was to be heard; and a stillness like the awful silence
of death spread over the assembly, as he proceeded in
melting strains to warn the careless, Christless sinner
to "flee from the wrath to come."</p>

<p>As winter was now approaching, Whitefield felt it
important to return to the metropolis. During the
tour he had made, he won to Christ not a few of those
who afterwards laid the foundations of churches now
flourishing in the counties of Lancaster, York, and
Northumberland. He met, however, with so much
"rude treatment here and there, as sent him home
praying, 'Lord, give me a pilgrim heart for my pilgrim
life.'" He was now in "winter quarters," but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
was neither idle nor useless. To use his own words,
"The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle, and the
shout of a king was in the camp," and that from week
to week. "Thousands, thousands crowded to hear."
Every day also he heard of instances of conversion.
One of these pleased him greatly. It was that of a
boatswain, who, before hearing him, knew no more
about divine truth "than the whistle he blew on
board." He mentions also a boy eleven years of age,
a woman of eighty, and a baker, who had been "a
Jerusalem sinner," all of whom bowed before the
cross, and placed their hopes of salvation on Him
who died thereon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>LABORS IN GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;FOURTH VISIT TO
AMERICA&mdash;NEW TABERNACLE IN LONDON, AND
TABERNACLE AT BRISTOL.<br />

1750-1754.</h3></blockquote>


<p>At the beginning of the year 1750, Whitefield was
still in London. At this time his intended college at
Bethesda occupied much of his attention. He wrote
to his friends in every quarter for help. His usual
appeal was, "We propose having an academy or college
at the orphan-house. The house is large, and
will hold a hundred. My <em>heart</em>, I trust, is larger, and
will hold ten thousand." Though in London, his
heart was in America. He says, "Ranging seems my
province; and methinks I hear a voice behind me saying,
'This is the way, walk in it.' My heart echoes
back, 'Lord, let thy presence go with me, and then
send me where thou pleasest.' In the midst of all,
America, <em>dear</em> America, is not forgotten. I begin to
count the days, and to say to the months, 'Fly fast
away, that I may spread the gospel-net once more in
dear America.'"</p>

<p>Be it here mentioned, that amid the busy scenes
of his life, and while surrounded with the flatteries of
the great and noble, Whitefield did not forget the
duties he owed to his mother. A person whom he had
employed to obtain some comforts for her, had neglected
the duty, so that the now aged matron might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
have felt a week's anxiety. He wrote to her, "I
should never forgive myself, was I, by negligence or
any wrong conduct, to give you a moment's needless
pain. Alas, how little have I done for you. Christ's
care for his mother excites me to wish I could do any
thing for you. If you would have any thing more
brought, pray write, honored mother. * * * Tomorrow
it will be <em>thirty-five</em> years since you brought
unworthy me into the world. O that my head were
waters, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might
bewail my barrenness and unfruitfulness in the church
of God."</p>

<p>While he was now fully engaged in preaching, and
was surrounded with flatteries, he did not forget his
duty to conflict with sin. He writes, "I find a love
of power sometimes intoxicates even God's dear children.
It is much easier for me to obey than govern.
This makes me fly from that which, at our first setting
out, we are apt to court. I cannot well buy humility
at too dear a rate."</p>

<p>Dr. Philip Doddridge, as every reader knows, was
one of the most pious and accomplished preachers and
writers of the Non-conformists of England in his day.
Nor was his <em>missionary</em> zeal small in its degree.
Though he died as early as 1751, he had said, "I am
now intent on having something done among the dissenters,
in a more public manner, for propagating the
gospel abroad, which lies near my heart. I wish to
live to see this design brought into execution, at least
into some forwardness, and then I should die the more
cheerfully." It was indeed the passion of his life to
promote the interests of evangelical truth, and save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the souls of men. And though, as his recent eulogist,
the Rev. John Stoughton, has said, condemned by
some, and suspected by others for so doing, he took a
deep and sympathetic interest in the evangelical labors
of Whitefield. It seems strange in our day to
think of Whitefield being regarded as an enthusiast
by orthodox dissenters. Yet there were those who
did thus regard him. Bradbury poured on him streams
of wit; Barker regarded his sermons as low and
coarse; and another in writing calls him "honest,
crazy, confident Mr. Whitefield." But Doddridge
regarded him as far otherwise, and spoke of him as
"a flaming servant of Christ." He prayed on one
occasion at the Tabernacle, but Dr. Watts was much
grieved by it; and when, on Whitefield's visiting
Northampton, Doddridge gave him the use of his
pulpit, the managers of the college of which he was
president remonstrated with him for so doing.</p>

<p>The visit of Whitefield to Doddridge was in February,
1750, where he met with the Rev. Dr. Sir James
Stonehouse, and the Rev. Messrs. Hartley and Hervey.
The latter eminent clergyman thus writes: "I have
lately seen that most excellent minister of the ever-blessed
Jesus, Mr. Whitefield. I dined, supped, and
spent the evening with him at Northampton, in company
with Dr. Doddridge, and two pious, ingenious
clergymen of the church of England, both of them
known to the learned world by their valuable writings.
And surely I never spent a more delightful
evening, or saw one that seemed to make nearer
approaches to the felicity of heaven. A gentleman of
great worth and rank in the town invited us to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
house, and gave us an elegant treat; but how mean
was his provision, how coarse his delicacies, compared
with the fruit of my friend's lips: they dropped as
honey from the honey-comb, and were a well of life.
Surely people do not know that amiable and exemplary
man, or else, I cannot but think, instead of
depreciating, they would applaud and love him. For
my part, I never beheld so fair a copy of our Lord,
such a living image of the Saviour, such exalted delight
in God, such enlarged benevolence to man, such
a steady faith in the divine promises, and such a fervent
zeal for the divine glory; and all this without
the least moroseness of humor, or extravagance of
behavior, sweetened with the most engaging cheerfulness
of temper, and regulated by all the sobriety of
reason and wisdom of Scripture; insomuch that I
cannot forbear applying the wise man's encomium of
an illustrious woman to this eminent minister of the
everlasting gospel: 'Many sons have done virtuously,
but thou excellest them all.'"</p>

<p>In the month of March, 1750, a general alarm had
been awakened by earthquakes in London, and fears
were excited by pretended prophecies of still greater
devastation. These signal judgments of Jehovah
were preceded by great profligacy of manners, and its
fruitful parent, licentiousness of principle. Dr. Horne,
afterwards dean of Canterbury and bishop of Bristol,
in a sermon preached at the time, says, "As to faith,
is not the doctrine of the Trinity, and that of the divinity
of our Lord and Saviour&mdash;without which our redemption
is absolutely void, and we are yet in our
sins, lying under the intolerable burden of the wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of God&mdash;blasphemed and ridiculed openly in conversation
and in print? And as to righteousness of life,
are not the people of this land dead in trespasses and
sins? Idleness, drunkenness, luxury, extravagance,
and debauchery; for these things cometh the wrath
of God, and disordered nature proclaims the impending
distress and perplexity of nations. And Oh, may
we of this nation never read a handwriting upon the
wall of heaven, in illuminated capitals of the Almighty,
<span class="smcap">Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</span>&mdash;God hath numbered
the kingdom, and finished it. Thou art weighed
in the balances of heaven, and found wanting the
merits of a rejected Redeemer, and therefore the kingdom
is divided and given away."</p>

<p>The shocks felt in London in February and March
of this year, were far more violent than any remembered
for a long series of years. The earth moved
throughout the whole cities of London and Westminster.
It was a strong and jarring motion, attended
with a rumbling noise like that of thunder. Multitudes
of persons of every class fled from these cities
with the utmost haste, and others repaired to the
fields and open places in the neighborhood. Towerhill,
Moorfields, and Hyde Park were crowded with
men, women, and children, who remained a whole
night under the most fearful apprehensions. Places
of worship were filled with persons in the utmost
state of alarm. Especially was this the case with
those attached to Methodist congregations, where
multitudes came all night, knocking at the doors, and
for God's sake begging admittance. As convulsions
of nature are usually regarded by enthusiasts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
fanatics as the sure harbinger of its dissolution, a
soldier "had a revelation," that a great part of London
and Westminster would be destroyed by an earthquake
on a certain night, between the hours of twelve
and one o'clock. Believing his assertion, thousands
fled from the city for fear of being suddenly overwhelmed,
and repaired to the fields, where they continued
all night, in momentary expectation of seeing
the prophecy fulfilled; while thousands of others ran
about the streets in the most wild and frantic state
of consternation, apparently quite certain that the
day of judgment was about to commence. The whole
scene was truly awful.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the ministers of Christ
preached almost incessantly, and many were awakened
to a sense of their awful condition before God, and to
rest their hopes of eternal salvation on the Rock of
ages. Mr. Whitefield, animated with that burning
charity which shone so conspicuously in him, ventured
out at midnight to Hyde Park, where he proclaimed
to the affrighted and astonished multitudes that there
is a Saviour, Christ the Lord. The darkness of the
night, and the awful apprehensions of an approaching
earthquake, added much to the solemnity of the scene.
The sermon was truly sublime, and to the ungodly
sinner, the self-righteous pharisee, and the artful hypocrite,
strikingly terrific. With a pathos which showed
the fervor of his soul, and with a grand majestic
voice that commanded attention, he took occasion from
the circumstances of the assembly, to call their attention
to that most important event in which every one
will be interested, the final consummation of all things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the universal wreck of nature, the dissolution of earth,
and the eternal sentence of every son and daughter of
Adam. The whole scene was one of a most memorable
character. Mr. Charles Wesley, Mr. Romaine,
and others preached in a similar manner, and with
like happy results.</p>

<p>At this period, Whitefield and his female friends
especially, were the subjects of royal attention at the
court of George the Second. It is said that on one
occasion Lady Chesterfield appeared in a dress "with
a brown ground and silver flowers," of foreign manufacture.
The king, smiling significantly, said to her
aloud, "I know who chose that gown for you&mdash;Mr.
Whitefield; I hear you have attended on him for a
year and a half." Her ladyship acknowledged she
had done so, and professed her approbation of his
character and ministry; and afterwards deeply regretted
that she had not said more when she had so
good an opportunity. Whitefield had occasion to
wait on the secretary of state, in company with Dr.
Gifford, a Baptist pastor in London, to ask relief for
some persecuted Christians in Ireland, and was assured
that "no hurt was designed by the state to the Methodists."
He also renewed his friendship with the
Messrs. Wesley, and several times exchanged pulpits
with them. He writes, "I have now preached thrice
in Mr. Wesley's chapel, and God was with us of a
truth."</p>

<p>Again was our evangelist tired of London, and
again had he grown sick for want of field-preaching.
Accordingly he set out for Bristol and other parts of
the west of England; and although rain and hail pelted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
him in his field-pulpits, he preached "about twenty
times in eight or nine days." As soon as he found
himself in his own element, he saw every thing in his
old lights. He says, "Every thing I meet with seems
to carry this voice with it: 'Go thou and preach the
gospel; be a pilgrim on earth; have no party, or
certain dwelling-place.' My heart echoes back, 'Lord
Jesus, help me to do or suffer thy will. When thou
seest me in danger of <em>nestling</em>, in pity, in tender pity
put a thorn in my nest, to prevent me from it.'"</p>

<p>From Bristol, Whitefield went to Taunton, where
he met with the Rev. Richard Pearsall, an eminent
and excellent Presbyterian minister, of whom he
speaks very highly; and from thence, on his way to
Plymouth, he stayed at Wellington, to preach for the
Rev. Risdon Darracott, who has ever since been distinguished
as "the star in the west." Mr. Darracott was
the son of a dissenting minister in Dorsetshire, where
he was born in 1717, when Whitefield was three years
old. He studied for the ministry under the Rev. Dr.
Doddridge, at Northampton, and entered on his ministerial
course in Cornwall in 1738, which situation
he was most reluctantly compelled to leave two years
afterwards from violent hemorrhage of the lungs.
Under this alarming visitation he spent about six
months with his friends in Devonshire, where his fervent-minded
father had preached till his death at the
age of forty. While here, he had a call to succeed a
venerable minister at Wellington, who had recently
deceased. He found the congregation small, and the
number of communicants but twenty-eight. His ministry
soon drew a large congregation, many of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
had never before made a profession of religion, and
were first attracted into the town from the neighboring
villages out of mere curiosity to hear him. The
house of worship was soon insufficient to contain his
hearers; and even when it was enlarged, many were
frequently compelled to stand out of doors, unable to
obtain an entrance. The Rev. Benjamin Fawcett, who
preached his funeral sermon, said, "I never knew any
congregation which appeared to have so many instances
of abiding religious impressions;" and added,
"I have good reason to believe that his ministry was
owned to the effectual conversion of many hundreds
of souls."</p>

<p>The night before the death of this excellent man,
which took place in his forty-second year, he exclaimed,
"Oh, what a good God have I, in and through
Jesus Christ. I would praise him, but my lips cannot.
Eternity will be too short to speak his praises."
The physician coming in, he said to him, "Oh, what a
mercy is it to be interested in the atoning blood of
Jesus. I come to the Lord as a vile sinner, trusting
in the merits and precious blood of my dear Redeemer.
O grace, grace, free grace!" His last words
were, "I am going from weeping friends to congratulating
angels, and rejoicing saints in glory. He is
coming. Oh, speed thy chariot wheels; why are they
so long in coming? I long to be gone!" He left in
his church more than two hundred communicants.</p>

<p>Whitefield and Darracott were congenial spirits,
and Darracott, like his friend, had suffered much reproach
in the cause of his Master; he was what
Whitefield called him, "a flaming and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
preacher of the gospel." He had just at this time
lost three lovely children. "Two of them," says
Whitefield, "had died on the Saturday evening before
the sacrament; but weeping did not prevent
sowing. He preached the next day, and administered
as usual. Our Lord strengthened him; and for his
three natural, gave him above <em>thirty</em> spiritual children;
and he is likely to have many more. He has
ventured his little all for Christ; and last week a
saint died who left him and his heirs two hundred
pounds in land. Did ever any one trust in God, and
was forsaken?" This interview with Darracott, and
with good old Mr. Pearsall, who had been a preacher
of righteousness before Whitefield was born, had an
inspiring influence upon him. He says, "I <em>began</em> to
take the field again at his dwelling for the spring!
I begin to <em>begin</em> to spend and be spent for Him who
shed his own dear heart's blood for me. He makes
<em>ranging</em> exceedingly pleasant."</p>

<p>Soon after this, Whitefield went again into Yorkshire.
At Rotherham he says, "Satan rallied his
forces. The crier was employed to give notice of a
bear-baiting. You may guess who was the bear!
However, I preached twice. The drum was heard,
and several watermen attended with great staves.
The constable was struck, and two of the mobbers
apprehended, but rescued afterwards." Sheffield and
Leeds he found to be a new and warmer climate.
Lancashire, however, was still but cold to him. All
was quiet at Manchester, and he "humbly hoped some
had enlisted," but no great impression was then made.
At Bolton, a drunkard stood up behind him to preach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and the wife of the man who lent him the field, twice
attempted to stab the workman who put up the stand
for him. This roused him, and he bore down all opposition
by a torrent of eloquence, which quite exhausted
him. In the night, however, some rude fellows
got into the barn and stables where his chaise
and horses had been put, and cut them very shamefully.
This conduct he called, "Satan showing his
teeth."</p>

<p>To narrate the particulars of this journey would
be little more than a repetition of scenes of insult and
of success with which the reader has already become
familiar. At Ulverston he says, "Satan made some
small resistance. A clergyman, who looked more like
a <em>butcher</em> than a minister, came with two others, and
charged a constable with me; but I never saw a poor
creature sent off with such disgrace."</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable conversions recorded
in the history of the church occurred during this journey
by the ministry of Mr. Whitefield. The full particulars
are recorded in the Life of the Countess of
Huntingdon, and can only be briefly mentioned here.</p>

<p>In the early period of Whitefield's ministry, many
of the taverns became places where his doctrines and
zeal were talked of and ridiculed. A Mr. Thorpe,
and several other young men in Yorkshire, undertook
at one of these parties to mimic the preaching of Mr.
Whitefield. The proposition met with applause; one
after another stood on a table to perform his part,
and it devolved on Mr. Thorpe to close this irreverent
scene. Much elated, and confident of success, he
exclaimed, as he ascended the table, "I shall beat you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
all." Who would have supposed that the mercy of
God was now about to be extended to this transgressor
of his law? The Bible was handed to him; and
by the guidance of unerring Providence, it opened at
Luke 13:3: "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish." The moment he read the text his mind was
impressed in a most extraordinary manner; he saw
clearly the nature and importance of the subject; and
as he afterwards said, if he ever preached with the
assistance of the Holy Spirit, it was at that time. His
address produced a feeling of depression in his auditors;
and when he had finished, he instantly retired
to weep over his sins. He soon after became associated
with the people of God, and died a successful
minister of Christ, at Masborough, in Yorkshire, in
1776, about six years after the death of Mr. Whitefield.
He was the father of the distinguished Rev.
William Thorpe, of Bristol.</p>

<p>Passing on to Edinburgh, Whitefield was, as usual,
received with the most unfeigned tenderness and joy,
preaching to great multitudes of attentive and serious
people, whose earnest desire to hear him made him
exert himself beyond his strength. He says, "By
preaching always twice, once thrice, and once four
times in a day, I am quite weakened; but I hope to
recruit again. Christ's presence makes me smile at
pain." He returned to London, having preached
about one hundred times, it was believed to not less
than one hundred thousand people.</p>

<p>Among the occasional hearers of Whitefield when
in Scotland, was the celebrated infidel historian, David
Hume. An intimate friend having asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
what he thought of Mr. Whitefield's preaching, he
replied, "He is, sir, the most ingenious preacher I
ever heard; it is worth while to go twenty miles to
hear him." He then repeated the following passage,
which occurred towards the close of the discourse he
had been hearing. "After a solemn pause, Mr. Whitefield
thus addressed his numerous audience: 'The attendant
angel is just about to leave the threshold, and
ascend to heaven. And shall he ascend, and not bear
with him the news of one sinner, among all this multitude,
reclaimed from the error of his ways?' To
give the greater effect to this exclamation, he stamped
with his foot, lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven,
and with gushing tears cried aloud, 'Stop, Gabriel!
stop, Gabriel! stop, ere you enter the sacred portals,
and yet carry with you the news of one sinner converted
to God.' He then, in the most simple but energetic
language, described what he called a Saviour's
dying love to sinful man, so that almost the whole assembly
melted into tears. This address was accompanied
with such animated, yet natural action, that it
surpassed any thing I ever saw or heard in any other
preacher."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1751, Whitefield paid a second
visit to Ireland, and was most hospitably received in
Dublin by a respectable and opulent gentleman named
Lunell, who had been brought to Christ by the first
Methodist itinerant preacher in that city. During
this excursion, Whitefield preached about eighty sermons,
fourteen of them in Dublin, and seven in Limerick.
His hearers in Dublin organized themselves into
a public society, which does not seem to have met his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
approbation. He says, "This morning I have been
talking with dear Mr. Adams, and can not help thinking
that you have run before the Lord, in forming
yourselves into a public society as you have done. I
am sincere when I profess that I do not choose to set
myself at the head of any party. When I came to Ireland,
my intention was to preach the gospel to all;
and if it should ever please the Lord of all lords to
send me thither again, I purpose to pursue the same
plan. For I am a debtor to all of every denomination,
and have no design, if I know any thing of this desperately
wicked and deceitful heart, but to promote the
common salvation of mankind. The love of Christ
constrains me to this."</p>

<p>During this visit, Whitefield a few times ventured
out of the city to Oxmantown-green, then a large open
place, situated near the royal barracks, where the Ormond
and Liberty boys, two factions among the lowest
class of the people, generally assembled on the
Sabbath to fight with each other. The congregations
at first were very numerous, and deeply affected, nor
did any disturbance occur. Thus encouraged, the
preacher ventured again, and gave notice of his intention
to resume his labors. He went through the barracks,
the door of which opened into the green, and
pitched his tent near the barrack walls, not doubting
of the protection, or at least of the interposition of
the officers and soldiers, if there should be occasion
for it. The multitude in attendance was indeed vast.
After singing and prayer, Whitefield preached without
molestation, except that now and then a few stones
and clods of dirt were thrown at him. It being war-time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
he took occasion to exhort his hearers, as was
his usual practice, not only to fear God, but to honor
the king; and prayed for the success of the king of
Prussia. When the service was over, he thought to
return home by the way he came, but, to his great surprise,
a passage through the barracks was denied;
and he was compelled to pass from one end of the
green to the other, through thousands of Roman-catholics.
He was unattended; for a soldier and four
preachers who came with him had fled from the scene
of danger, and he was seriously attacked by the mob.
They threw vollies of stones upon him from all quarters,
and he reeled backwards and forwards till he
was almost breathless and covered with blood. At
length, with great difficulty he staggered to the door
of a minister's house near the green, which was kindly
opened to him. For a while he continued speechless,
and panting for breath; but his weeping friends
having given him a cordial, and washed his wounds,
a coach was procured, in which, amidst the oaths, imprecations,
and threatenings of the rabble, he got safe
home, and united in a hymn of thanksgiving with his
friends. In a letter written to a friend soon after this
event, he says, "I received many blows and wounds;
one was particularly large, and near my temple: I
thought of Stephen, and was in hopes, like him, to go
off in this bloody triumph to the immediate presence
of my Master."</p>

<p>Unpromising, however, as things were in Ireland,
the labors of Whitefield, followed as they were by
those of the Wesleys, became the foundation of a number
of Christian societies that proved vast blessings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
to Ireland; and some of them grew into large churches,
which continue to flourish till this day.</p>

<p>The society to which reference has been made,
which assembled in Skinner's alley, secured ministerial
aid from the late Rev. John Edwards, who was one of
Whitefield's converts, and among the earliest preachers
at the Tabernacle in London; and who also itinerated
over nearly the whole of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
The period was one of great persecution, and
this good man had several remarkable preservations
from death. At one time, while he resided in Dublin,
he was returning from preaching at a village, when he
was seized by a party of rude fellows, who declared
they would throw him over the bridge into the Liffey.
This was observed by an opposite political party, residing
on the other side of the river, who encountered his
assailants, and rescued him out of their hands, saying
he lived on their side the river, and none should hurt
him. At another time, having preached out of doors,
a furious mob of the <em>White-boys</em>, a political party so
called, beset the house in which he was, and threatened
to burn it to the ground, unless he was driven
out of it. His anxious friends could see but one way
for his escape, which was through a window that opened
into a garden belonging to a justice of the peace,
who was himself a violent persecutor of the Methodists.
Through this window Mr. Edwards was, like
the apostle Paul, let down in a basket. Here he stood
some time in great consternation, fearing the family
might observe him, and charge him with breaking into
the garden for improper purposes, and so both religion
and himself would be injured. At length he ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
to knock at the door, and asked for the magistrate, to
whom he ingenuously stated the facts, and who most
generously protected and extended to him the hospitalities
of his house for two days.</p>

<p>One fact more must be told of this excellent man.
He resolved to visit a town to which had removed a
number of soldiers who had received benefit from his
ministry. He was met, however, by some of these
pious men, who told him that the inhabitants were
determined to take his life. Edwards was not to be
dissuaded from his purpose; and on his arrival he
immediately preached in the street, and several distinguished
persons, including the mayor of the town,
came to hear him, and by their influence prevented disturbance.
After the service, the mayor invited him
to breakfast with several of the principal inhabitants,
and told him they were very glad he was come&mdash;that
the people were extremely dissolute in their manners,
and the clergy, both Protestants and Catholics, exceedingly
remiss in their duty, and they hoped the
Methodists would succeed in reforming the town.
These gentlemen subscribed to the support of stated
preaching, and extensive and lasting good was done.</p>

<p>Amid Whitefield's innumerable engagements and
declining health, Bethesda and his beloved America
could not be forgotten. While he was at Glasgow
during this summer of 1751, he was greatly delighted
to hear that Mr. Dinwiddie, brother-in-law to the Rev.
Mr. M'Culloch, of Cambuslang, was appointed governor
of Virginia. The gospel had been much opposed
there, and he thought the appointment now made
would greatly tend to check persecution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield, as it appears to us, now very suddenly
determined on another voyage to America. He arrived
in London from Edinburgh in the early part of
August, with improved health, the country air having
healed his hemorrhage. He took a hasty leave of his
friends, and set sail for Georgia, in the Antelope,
Captain M'Lellan, taking several orphans with him.
He arrived at Savannah Oct. 27, and had the happiness
of finding the orphan-house in a prosperous condition.
Here, however, he did not stay long; as in
November we hear of him in his usual labors, and
with his usual ardor engaged in his constant work of
preaching. Having formerly suffered much from the
climate of America in the summer, he determined
again to embark for London, which he did in April.
We can scarcely trace his object in this journey to
and from America, except in some designs of the government
to place Georgia on a new footing.</p>

<p>In June, 1752, Mr. Whitefield was found in the
society of the Countess of Huntingdon at Bath, where
he continued about three weeks, preaching every evening
to great numbers of the nobility. Here he became
acquainted with Mrs. Grinfield, a lady who attended
on the person of Queen Caroline. "One of C&#230;sar's
household," he writes, "hath been lately awakened,
through her ladyship's instrumentality, and I hope
others will meet with the like blessing." He afterwards
visited her at the palace of St. James, and says,
"The court, I believe, rings of her, and if she stands,
I trust she will make a glorious martyr for her blessed
Lord."</p>

<p>The Moravians, or United Brethren, were at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
period on terms of very cordial friendship with the
Messrs. Wesley and Whitefield. At the time of which
we are writing, a series of strange absurdities, resembling
the adoration of saints and other superstitions
of popery, developed themselves among members of
that body, at the head of which then stood Count
Zinzendorf, to whom Whitefield wrote an urgent
remonstrance on the subject. An open separation
took place, and Mrs. Grinfield, the Rev. John Cennick,
and some others, adhered to the count, while
Whitefield and Lady Huntingdon endeavored to bring
him back to what they believed the simplicity of the
gospel. Lady Huntingdon, speaking of her final
interview with him, says, "Our conference was long,
and as the count honored me with his company for a
few days, was resumed at intervals, always closing
with a solemn scriptural prayer to our great and glorious
Head, for the illuminating influences of his Spirit
to guide us into all truth. We parted with the utmost
cordiality."</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Whitefield's letter," says Lady Huntingdon,
"has much grieved the count. But his remonstrance
is faithful, and the awful exposures he has
reluctantly been forced to make, may be productive of
the highest good in opening the eyes of many to the
miserable delusions under which they lie."</p>

<p>A correspondence, indeed we may say friendship,
had for years existed between Whitefield and the
eminent philosopher Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The
following, from a letter of Whitefield, August 17,
1752, shows his fidelity to the eminent citizen and
statesman: "I find you grow more and more famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
in the learned world. As you have made a pretty
considerable progress in the mysteries of electricity,
I would now humbly recommend to your diligent,
unprejudiced pursuit and study, the mystery of the
new birth. It is a most important, interesting study,
and when mastered, will richly answer and repay you
for all your pains. One, at whose bar we are shortly
to appear, hath solemnly declared that, without it, we
cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. You will
excuse this freedom. I must have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquid Christi</i>&mdash;something
of Christ, in all my letters." This honest
letter ought to have delighted the philosopher in his
closet, even more than the eulogium he heard while
standing behind the bar of the House of Lords, when
Earl Chatham said of him, "Franklin is one whom
Europe holds in high estimation for his knowledge
and wisdom; one who is an honor, not to the English
nation only, but to human nature."</p>

<p>In the course of the summer of 1752, and the following
one, Whitefield visited Scotland twice, and
preached much also throughout England and Wales.
As usual, he greatly rejoiced in the presence and service
of God, and never appears to have been more
happy than in this period of his life. "Since I left
Newcastle," he writes, "I have scarcely known sometimes
whether I have been in heaven or on earth.
Thousands and thousands flock twice or thrice a day
to hear the word of life. God favors us with weather,
and I would fain make hay while the sun shines. Oh
that I had as many tongues as there are hairs in my
head. The ever-loving, ever-lovely Jesus should have
them all. Fain would I die preaching."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>About this period also, Mr. Hervey and he were
employed in revising each other's manuscripts; the
former was then preparing his "Theron and Aspasio,"
a work which, though florid in its style, has been
eminently useful in conducting many of its readers to
a saving knowledge of the doctrines of the gospel.
Of his friend's writings Mr. Whitefield says, "For me
to play the critic on them, would be like holding up
a candle to the sun. However, I will just mark a few
places, as you desire. I foretell their fate; nothing
but your scenery can screen you. Self will never bear
to die, though slain in so genteel a manner, without
showing some resentment against its artful murderer....
I thank you a thousand times for the trouble
you have been at in revising my poor compositions,
which I am afraid you have not treated with a becoming
severity. How many pardons shall I ask for
mangling, and, I fear, murdering your 'Theron and
Aspasio?' If you think my two sermons will do for
the public, pray return them immediately. I have
nothing to comfort me but this, that the Lord chooses
the weak things of this world to confound the strong,
and things that are not, to bring to naught things that
are. I write for the poor; you for the polite and
noble. God will assuredly own and bless what you
write."</p>

<p>Whitefield was now also very busy in erecting his
second London Tabernacle, which he dedicated, June
10, 1753. We have, for the sake of completing the
narrative of its first building, already given in our
third chapter a statement of the second tabernacle, to
which the reader is referred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the judgment and inclination of Mr. Whitefield
concurred to induce him to persevere in his itinerant
course, correctly judging that in this way he best
employed his peculiar talents. After preaching, therefore,
with his usual fervor and success for a short time
in his newly erected Tabernacle, he again set out towards
Scotland, where he spent some days at Edinburgh
and Glasgow, and preached generally twice,
sometimes three times a day, and once five times. He
says, "Attention sat upon all faces, and friends came
round like bees, importuning me to stay another week."
This he found too much for his strength, but still went
forward, often expressing his desire to serve his divine
Master to the utmost limit of his power, and his hopes
to be with him soon in heaven. During this journey,
including his return to London, where he arrived the
latter end of September, he travelled about twelve
hundred miles, and preached one hundred and eighty
times, to many thousands of hearers.</p>

<p>As converts increased in Bristol and its neighborhood,
Mr. Whitefield felt compelled to erect there
also a "tabernacle." Lady Huntingdon was one of
the earliest contributors to this important object, and
through her influence Lord Chesterfield gave twenty
pounds to it. He had no taste for religion, but he
well understood oratory, and in his letter to Lady
Huntingdon covering his remittance, he said, "Mr.
Whitefield's eloquence is unrivalled, his zeal inexhaustible."
The Earl of Bath sent fifty pounds, saying,
"Mocked and reviled as Mr. Whitefield is by all
ranks of society, still, I contend that the day will
come when England will be just, and own his greatness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
as a reformer, and his goodness as a minister of
the most high God."</p>

<p>The Tabernacle at Bristol was dedicated November
25, 1753, with a sermon from Whitefield. Its
history is one of deep interest. Its early ministers
were worthy of any age, but remarkably fitted for that
in which their lot was cast; men of pith and power,
undismayed at dangers, braving all kinds of difficulty
and toil, and prepared equally for labor and sufferings
in the cause of their great Master. Nor have
later ministers dishonored their predecessors; the
cause still flourishes, and the hallowed house has been
the birthplace of many eminent Christians. What
Whitefield then said of this house might often be said
of it now: "It is large, but not half large enough; for
if the place could contain them, nearly as many would
attend as in London." He always delighted in his
visits to this place, and laid here a foundation for vast
benefits, even to the present day. On one of his visits
to preach here, he began a series of sermons on the
evening before the commencement of the fair. His
text was, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye,
buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without
money, and without price." Isa. 55:1. The congregation
was large, and thus he began: "My dear hearers,
I fear that many of you are come to attend Bristol
fair. So am I. You do not mean to show your
goods until to-morrow; but I shall exhibit mine to-night.
You are afraid purchasers will not come up
to your price; but I am afraid my buyers will not
come down to mine; for mine," striking his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
on the Bible, "are 'without money, and without
price.'"</p>

<p>After the dedication of this Bristol Tabernacle,
Whitefield preached in the open air in various parts
of Somersetshire, at seven o'clock at night. "My
hands and body," says he, "were pierced with cold;
but what are outward things, when the soul is warmed
with the love of God? The stars shone with exceeding
brightness; by an eye of faith I saw Him who
'calleth them all by their names.' My soul was filled
with a holy ambition, and I longed to be one of those
who 'shall shine as the stars for ever and ever.'"</p>

<p>At this time he had a fine opportunity to show his
Christian attachment to his old friends. Mr. John
Wesley had, by a series of extraordinary labors,
brought his life into great danger, and Whitefield,
hearing of this while at Bristol, wrote a sympathizing
letter to his brother Charles, in which he prays for
the descending garment of Elijah to rest on the surviving
Elisha, and encloses an ardent and solemn
farewell to the invalid, who was supposed to be dying.
He says, "The news and prospect of your approaching
dissolution have quite weighed me down. I pity
myself and the church, but not you. A radiant throne
awaits you, and ere long you will enter into your
Master's joy. Yonder he stands with a massy crown,
ready to put it on your head, amidst an admiring
throng of saints and angels. But I, poor I, that have
been waiting for my dissolution these nineteen years,
must be left behind to grovel here below. Well, this
is my comfort, it cannot be long ere the chariots will
be sent even for worthless me. If prayers can detain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
you, even you, reverend and very dear sir, shall not
leave us yet. But if the decree is gone forth that you
must now sleep in Jesus, may he kiss your soul away,
and give you to die in the embraces of triumphant love.
If in the land of the living, I hope to pay my best
respects to you next week. If not, reverend and dear
sir, farewell." He had soon the satisfaction of witnessing
the recovery of his friend, who was to survive
him more than twenty years.</p>

<p>We have already intimated that Whitefield used
his influence in Scotland in favor of the New Jersey
college, located at Princeton. In accordance with
his advice, the friends of the college in this country
sent over the Rev. Samuel Davies, afterwards president
of the college, and the Rev. Gilbert Tennent, to
promote its interests in the British islands. A few
extracts from the manuscript diary of Davies, with
the use of which we have been favored for this volume,
will show the readiness of Whitefield to labor, or to
"be nothing," so that the cause of Christ might be
advanced. The deputation arrived in England in the
closing month of 1753, and thus writes Davies:</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 26. Mr. Whitefield having
sent us an invitation last night to make his house
our home during our stay here, we were perplexed
what to do, lest we should blast the success of our
mission among the dissenters, who are generally disaffected
to him. We at length concluded, with the
advice of our friends and his, that a public intercourse
with him would be imprudent, in our present situation,
and visited him privately this evening; and the kind
reception he gave us revived dear Mr. Tennent. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
spoke in the most encouraging manner as to the success
of our mission. And in all his conversation discovered
so much zeal and candor, that I could not but
admire the man as the wonder of the age. When we
returned, Mr. Tennent's heart was all on fire, and
after we had gone to bed, he suggested that we should
watch and pray; and we rose and prayed together
till about three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Jan. 1. Went in the evening to hear Mr. Whitefield
in the Tabernacle, a large, spacious building.
The assembly was very numerous, though not equal to
what is common. He preached on the parable of the
barren fig-tree; and though the discourse was incoherent,
yet it seemed to me better calculated to do
good to mankind than all the accurate, languid discourses
I ever heard. After sermon I enjoyed his
pleasing conversation at his house."</p>

<p>It would seem that Messrs. Davies and Tennent had
their trials, as well as their encouragements. Writing
Jan. 14, Mr. Davies says, "Spent an hour with
Mr. Whitefield. He thinks we have not taken the
best method in endeavoring to keep in with all parties,
but should 'come out boldly,' as he expressed it,
which would secure the affections of the pious people,
from whom we might expect the most generous contributions."
On the evening after this, they dined
with Whitefield at the house of a common friend, and
he rejoiced in the abundant success they afterwards
met with from nearly all parties.</p>

<p>"Jan. 25. Dined with Mr. Bradbury, who has
been in the ministry about fifty-seven years. He read
us some letters which passed between Mr. Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and him, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno</i> 1741; occasioned by Mr. Whitefield's
reproving him in a letter for singing a song in a tavern,
in a large company, in praise of old English beef.
The old gentleman sung it to us, and we found it was
partly composed by himself, in the high-flying days of
Queen Anne. He is a man of a singular turn, which
would be offensive to the greatest number of serious
people; but for my part I could say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">'I knew 'twas his peculiar whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor took it ill, as't came from him.'"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In March, 1754, Whitefield, in company with twenty-two
poor destitute children, sailed the fifth time for
America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>FIFTH VISIT TO AMERICA&mdash;RENEWED LABORS IN
GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;TOTTENHAM-COURT-ROAD CHAPEL.<br />

1754-1763.</h3></blockquote>

<p>On this voyage to America, Whitefield sailed for
South Carolina by way of Lisbon. His health demanded
repose; he thought that seeing Popery as it is
when unrestrained by public opinion, might be of use
to him in his future labors; and moreover, he had with
him a number of orphans whom he wished comfortably
to settle at Bethesda before he visited the northern
provinces. It would be pleasant, if our limits would
allow it, to furnish the letters he wrote from Lisbon
during nearly four weeks, but a few sentences must suffice:
"This leaves me an inhabitant of Lisbon. We
have now been here almost a week, and I suppose shall
stay a fortnight longer. A reputable merchant has
received me into his house, and every day shows me the
ecclesiastical curiosities of the country. O, my dear
friend, bless the Lord of all lords, for causing your
lot to be cast in such a fair ground as England, and
giving you such a goodly heritage. It is impossible to
be sufficiently thankful for civil and religious liberty,
for simplicity of worship, and powerful preaching of
the word of God. O for simplicity of manners, and a
correspondent behavior. The air agrees with my
poor constitution extremely well. Through divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
assistance; I hope what I see will also improve my
better part, and help to qualify me better for preaching
the everlasting gospel."</p>

<p>In another letter he writes, "Never did civil and
religious liberty appear to me in so amiable a light
as now. What a spirit must Martin Luther and the
first reformers be endued with, that dared to appear
as they did for God. Lord, hasten that blessed time
when others, excited by the same spirit, shall perform
like wonders. Oh, happy England! Oh, happy Methodists,
who are Methodists indeed! And all I account
such, who, being dead to sects and parties, aim at
nothing else but as holy a method of living to, and
dying in the blessed Jesus."</p>

<p>He was heartily glad to get away from Popish
processions and superstitious rites, and again to visit
his "dear America."</p>

<p>Our evangelist arrived with his orphans at Beaufort,
in South Carolina, May 27, 1754, greatly improved
in health, with a heart burning with love and
zeal for his Lord and Master. He says, with his
usual energy, "Oh that I may at length learn to begin
to live. I am ashamed of my sloth and lukewarmness,
and long to be on the stretch for God." His family
now consisted, "black and white," of one hundred and
six members, all dependent on his personal efforts
and influence. He regarded his charge as a stewardship
for God, and collected accordingly, nothing doubting.
It was now summer, and besides the oppressive
heat, "great thunders, violent lightnings, and heavy
rains" frequently beat upon him as he journeyed from
place to place. His health improved, and his spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
rose as he advanced on his journey. At Charleston,
and elsewhere, his labors were received with the same
degree of acceptance as formerly, and he was much
encouraged by the conversion of a clergyman, a faithful
successor to Mr. Smith of the city just named, and
the first student sent forth from Bethesda.</p>

<p>He arrived at New York, by water, July 27, and
divided his labors between that city and Philadelphia
almost entirely for nearly two months. In the latter
city, he tells us, he was seized with violent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cholera
morbus</i>, and brought to the gates of death. To use
his own words, he "had all his cables out, ready to
cast anchor within the port of eternity;" but he was
soon "at sea again," although only able to preach
once a day for some time. "Everywhere," he says,
"a divine power accompanied the word, prejudices
were removed, and a more effectual door opened than
ever for preaching the gospel." When he looked at
"the glorious range for hunting in the American
woods," he was at a loss on which hand to turn....
"Affection, intense affection cries aloud, Away to New
England, <em>dear</em> New England, immediately. Providence,
and the circumstances of the southern provinces,
point directly to Virginia."</p>

<p>While thus undecided, he visited his old friend
Governor Belcher, then governor of New Jersey, and
residing at Elizabeth town. He found the good old
man ripening for heaven, willing to depart and to be
with Christ. At this time the commencement of New
Jersey college was held, and as a mark of their respect,
the president and trustees conferred on him the
honorary degree of master of arts. The meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the synod immediately followed, respecting which body
he says, "I was much refreshed with the company of
the whole synod; such a number of simple-hearted,
united ministers I never saw before. I preached to
them several times, and the great Master of assemblies
was in the midst of us."</p>

<p>Influenced by what he saw and heard in New Jersey,
Whitefield determined to go to New England,
and to return from thence by Virginia to Georgia,
and made his arrangements accordingly; it would
comprise a circuit of more than two thousand miles,
but he said, "The Redeemer's strength will be more
than sufficient."</p>

<p>It has been thought that it was during this visit of
Whitefield to New Jersey, and probably at the table
of Governor Belcher, that he dined in company with
a number of ministers, and held the often-reported
conversation with "Father Tennent." After dinner,
Mr. Whitefield adverted to the difficulties attending
the Christian ministry; lamented that all their zeal
availed but little; said that he was weary with the
burden of the day; and declared his great comfort in
the thought, that in a short time his work would be
done, when he should depart and be with Christ. He
then appealed to the ministers, if it was not their
great comfort that they should soon go to rest. They
generally assented, except Mr. Tennent, who sat next
to Mr. Whitefield in silence, and by his countenance
indicated but little pleasure in the conversation.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Mr. Whitefield, gently tapping him on
the knee, said, "Well, brother Tennent, you are the
oldest man among us; do you not rejoice to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
your time is so near at hand, when you will be called
home?" Mr. Tennent bluntly answered, "I have no
wish about it." Mr. Whitefield pressed him again.
Mr. Tennent again answered, "No, sir, it is no pleasure
to me at all; and if you knew your duty, it would
be none to you. I have nothing to do with death;
my business is to live as long as I can, as well as I
can, until He shall think proper to call me home."
Mr. Whitefield still urged for an explicit answer to
his question, in case the time of death were left to his
own choice. Mr. Tennent replied, "I have no choice
about it; I am God's servant, and have engaged to do
his business as long as he pleases to continue me therein.
But now, brother, let me ask you a question.
What do you think I should say, if I was to send my
servant into the field to plough; and if at noon I
should go to the field, and find him lounging under a
tree, and complaining, 'Master, the sun is very hot,
and the ploughing hard; I am weary of the work you
have appointed me, and am overdone with the heat
and burden of the day. Do, master, let me return
home, and be discharged from this hard service?'
What should I say? Why, that he was a lazy fellow,
and that it was his business to do the work that I had
appointed him, until I should think fit to call him
home."</p>

<p>Accompanied by President Burr, Whitefield set
out, October 1, for Boston, and arrived there on the
9th. Here he stayed a week, and saw there, morning
after morning, three or four thousand people hanging
in breathless silence on his lips, and weeping silent
tears. Whitefield himself calls it "a lovely scene,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and says he "never saw a more effectual door opened
for the gospel. Sinners have been awakened, saints
quickened, and enemies made at peace with me.
Grace, grace! Surely my coming here was of God.
Convictions <em>do</em> fasten, and many souls are comforted."
Such were the crowds at the early sermons, that in
order to reach the pulpit, he had to get in at the windows
of the churches. In a letter to the Countess of
Huntingdon, he wrote, "In Boston, the tide ran full
as high as ever your ladyship knew it at Edinburgh,
or in any part of Scotland."</p>

<p>While at Boston, Whitefield heard with much
pleasure of the appointment of his friend Habersham
as secretary to the new governor of Georgia, and
wrote to him, "I wish you joy of your new honor.
May the King of kings enable you to discharge your
trust as becomes a good patriot, subject, and Christian.
You have now a call, I think, to retire from
business, and to give up your time to the public."
Our evangelist travelled north as far as Portsmouth,
in New Hampshire, generally preaching two or three
times a day, till November 7, when he took his farewell
at Boston, at four o'clock in the morning. Speaking
of this journey, he says, "What have I seen?
Dagon falling everywhere before the ark; enemies
silenced, or made to own the finger of God; and the
friends of Jesus triumphing in his glorious conquests.
A hundredth part cannot be told. We had scarcely
one dry meeting." When he arrived in the neighborhood
of Portsmouth, the northern boundary of his
journey, he was overwhelmed with humility as well as
joy, by the large cavalcade which came out to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and welcome him. He says of them, "They were too
many;" and of this northern journey, "It seems to me
the most important one I was ever engaged in."</p>

<p>Of no portion of Whitefield's life are we so ignorant
as of the journey he now made from New England
to the South. Journal, letters, historians, and
newspapers alike fail us. Gillies tells us only that
from Boston he "proceeded to Rhode Island, and
went onward through Maryland and Virginia, with a
prospect so pleasing, that he lamented he had not
come sooner. The whole country seemed eager to
hear the gospel, many coming forty or fifty miles, and
a spirit of conviction and consolation appeared in
every congregation. Prejudices seemed to have fled;
churches were opened to him; high and low, rich and
poor, now seemed to think favorably of his ministrations;
and many acknowledged what God had done
for their souls through his preaching, when he was
there before." It scarcely appears probable that he
went from Rhode Island to Maryland by water; but
if he did not, he must have passed through New York,
New Jersey, and Philadelphia, and we feel somewhat
of surprise that no records of the journey appear to
have been preserved.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin relates a very characteristic anecdote
of Mr. Whitefield, which probably occurred in
Philadelphia or its neighborhood at a period not later
than this. "The eloquent orator" was preaching in
an open field, when a drummer was present, who was
determined to interrupt the preacher, and rudely beat
his drum in a violent manner, in order to drown his
voice. Whitefield spoke very loud, but could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
make so much noise as the instrument. He therefore
called out to the drummer, "Friend, you and I serve
the two greatest masters existing, but in different
callings. You beat up for volunteers for King George,
I for the Lord Jesus: in God's name, then, let us not
interrupt each other; the world is wide enough for
both, and we may get recruits in abundance." This
speech had such an effect on the drummer, that he
went away in great good-humor, and left the preacher
in full possession of the field.</p>

<p>Virginia, alike from the success of his former labors
there, and from the general characteristics of the people,
must have presented a scene of intense interest to
Whitefield at this time. Everywhere great preparations
were made for his coming, and large congregations
assembled to hear him. It is said, that on one
occasion, as he was speaking on the banks of one of
the rivers of this noble province, and spoke of the
strength of human depravity, and the insufficiency of
the means of grace to convert the sinner without the
influence of the Holy Spirit: "Sinners," said he, "think
not that I expect to convert a single soul of you by
any thing that I can say, without the assistance of
Him who is 'mighty to save.' Go and stand by that
river, as it moves on its strong and deep current to
the ocean, and bid it stop, and see if it will obey you.
Just as soon should I expect to stop that river by a
word, as by my preaching to stop that current of sin
which is carrying you to perdition. Father in heaven,
see! they are hurried on towards hell; save them,
or they perish!" The impression which this address
produced on his hearers was so strong, that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
ready to respond with trembling, "Save, Lord; we
perish!"</p>

<p>Whitefield must have been highly gratified on
reaching Charleston, in attending the ordination of
the young minister there, his first student from Bethesda,
of whom we have already spoken as succeeding
Mr. Smith; and not less would he rejoice that
one of the actors at the Charleston theatre had been
"snatched as a brand from the burning."</p>

<p>Though we have not the exact date of his arrival
at Savannah, we know that he remained there but a
very short time. His health again declined, his former
vomitings returned with violence, and his animal
spirits failed with his strength. In February, 1755,
we again find him at Charleston; and in the latter end
of March, he embarked for England, arriving, after a
comparatively short voyage, at Newhaven, in Sussex,
May the eighth.</p>

<p>Two strong impressions were made on the mind
of Whitefield as he now looked on his native land.
The first was that of grief on account of its condition.
Nothing less than war with France was daily expected,
for the French threatened to invade Britain, and
were constantly making encroachments on her American
colonies. "At this time," he says, "next to Jesus
Christ, my king and my country were upon my heart,
I hope I shall always think it my duty, next to inviting
sinners to the blessed Jesus, to exhort my hearers
to resist the first approaches of popish tyranny and
arbitrary power. O that we may be enabled to watch
and pray against all the opposition of antichrist in
our own hearts; for, after all, there lies the most dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
man of sin." His second feeling was one of
holy joy; for during his absence the preaching of the
gospel had been abundantly successful. He writes,
"Glory be to the great Head of the church! The
poor despised Methodists are as lively as ever; and
in several churches the gospel is now preached with
power. Many in Oxford are awakened to the knowledge
of the truth; and I have heard almost every
week of some fresh minister or another, who seems
'determined to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and
him crucified.'"</p>

<p>At the Tabernacle in London, as might be expected,
Whitefield enjoyed what he terms "golden
seasons;" but by this time not a few of the London
clergy had begun to preach Christ with holy fidelity;
and as this was the principal thing he desired, he says
his "call to go abroad was still more clear." Indeed,
so little did he now esteem London as a sphere of labor,
and so much did he regard places by the amount
of their destitution, that he wished at once to return
to America, without ranging through England or
Scotland. Hence he says, "Methinks I could set out
for America to-morrow, though I have not yet entered
upon my country range."</p>

<p>But if he loved America most, England loved herself
more, and he was drawn again into Gloucestershire
and Bristol. He went also, at the request of
Lady Huntingdon, to dedicate the new Tabernacle at
Norwich, to which we have already referred. At this
last place, he says, August 30, 1755, "Notwithstanding
offences have come, there has been a glorious work
begun, and is now carrying on. The polite and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
seem to hear with much attention; and I scarcely
ever preached a week together with greater freedom."
For a long period the work of God abundantly prospered
in connection with this "Tabernacle." Two
years after its dedication, the Hon. and Rev. Walter
Shirley preached some time in it, and had eight hundred
communicants in fellowship, and he said of them,
"Their experience, lives, and conversation are so
excellent, that there is nothing like it in the whole
kingdom."</p>

<p>On Whitefield's return to London, there were
those who urgently entreated him to engage in a new
controversy with the Messrs. Wesley, some of whose
followers had been jealous of his success at Norwich.
He declined, with his common remark, "I have no
time for controversy," and reserved what he had to
say till he could see them "face to face," simply writing
to assure them that he had no party designs on
foot.</p>

<p>Very soon after this, he set out for his northern
circuit; and wonderfully indeed did the Lord grant
him success. One thing, however, on this journey
grieved him. His friends at Leeds, without his knowledge,
had built a large church edifice. He saw at
once, that this circumstance would create an "awful
separation among the societies" formed by the Messrs.
Wesley and his own friends; and lost no time in writing
to those ministers, that they might endeavor to
prevent a breach. Both the plan and the spirit of
this undertaking so grieved him, that he exclaimed,
"Oh this self-love, this self-will, is the <em>devil of devils</em>."
This he wrote to Lady Huntingdon, a proof that party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
was not their object; and it is pleasant to add, that
Whitefield's fears were groundless. Leeds, even then,
contained population sufficient to fill both houses, and
the whole movement "fell out rather to the furtherance
of the gospel." During two months he preached
twice, and some days three times, to greater numbers
than ever before, inviting them to Christ, and "exhorting
them to pray for King George, and the dear
friends in America." He heard at this time, that the
American ladies were making the soldiers' coats; and
he immediately wrote to urge his own female friends
in the new world to be "some of the most active in
this labor of love."</p>

<p>Though Mr. Whitefield stood very high in the
esteem of that class of ministers who embraced his
views of evangelical truth, and who approved the
plans he pursued for the evangelization of the world,
they never considered him perfect, nor were some of
them backward, when they deemed it needful, to reprove
him. In a sermon he once preached in Haworth
church, Yorkshire, of which his friend Grimshaw
was the minister, having spoken severely of those
professors of the gospel who, by their loose and evil
conduct, caused the ways of truth to be evil spoken
of, he intimated his hope, that it was not necessary
to enlarge much on that topic to the congregation
before him, who had so long enjoyed the labors of
an able and faithful preacher; and he was willing
to believe that their profiting appeared to all men.
This latter expression roused Mr. Grimshaw's spirit,
and notwithstanding his great regard for the preacher,
he stood up and interrupted him, saying, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
loud voice, "O sir, for God's sake, do not speak so;
I pray you, do not flatter. I fear the greater part of
them are going to hell with their eyes open."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the astonishing labors of Whitefield
on this tour, he returned to London apparently
in full flesh, and was congratulated by his friends
on his improved appearance. Alas, all this, as he
well knew, was disease, which indeed very soon became
apparent. He was seized with inflammatory
sore throat, that was followed by quinsy, assuming an
almost fatal aspect. One physician prescribed silence
and warmth, and the preacher "promised to be very
obedient," but a few days afterwards, another recommended
a perpetual blister: this proposal roused him,
and he determined to try his own remedy&mdash;perpetual
preaching. The remedy itself was painful, but he
said, "When this grand catholicon fails, it is all over
with me." At this time the sad news of the earthquake
at Lisbon arrived in London; he was unable
to preach on the subject, but when told of it he said,
"Blessed be God, I am ready; I know that my Redeemer
liveth. Oh that all in Portugal had known
this! Then an earthquake would only be a <em>rumbling</em>
chariot to carry the soul to God. Poor Lisbon, how
soon are thy riches and superstitious pageantry swallowed
up!"</p>

<p>In the winter of 1755-6, he was applied to to preach
in the vicinity of the two great theatres, which he
began to do in Long Acre chapel. Disturbances took
place, and the Bishop of London interposed to stop
him. In the end he erected Tottenham Court-road
chapel, as already detailed in our third chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield's ministry in London at this time
was still successful. Thousands hung on his lips with
delight, not a few of whom were won to the service
of Christ. He tells us, among many similar facts, of
the conversion of a Mr. Crane, who was afterwards
appointed steward of the orphan-house in Georgia.
This gentleman had one evening determined to visit
the theatre, and set out for Drury-lane; that house
being crowded, he resolved to go to Covent-garden;
that also being so full that he could not obtain admittance,
he changed his plan, and resolved on being entertained
with one of Whitefield's sermons, and hastened
to Tottenham Court-road chapel. It pleased
God to impress the word on his heart, and he became
an eminent Christian. So truly is the prediction verified,
"I am found of them who sought me not."</p>

<p>During this year he published "A Short Address
to Persons of all Denominations, occasioned by an
Alarm of an intended Invasion." We have examined
it, and not without pleasure. It is a faithful exposure
of Popery and its bitter fruits.</p>

<p>It is a charge often preferred against the faithful
ministers of Christ, by those whose consciences testify
to their own guilt, that they are <em>personal</em> in their remarks,
and mean to censure particular individuals.
It is certain that this was often done by Mr. Whitefield,
and sometimes with very happy effect. He once
drew, from the conduct of his female servant, the picture
of a Christian failing in his duty, which painfully
distressed her, till he gave her an assurance of his
entire forgiveness.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only time when his hearers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
compelled to feel, "he means <em>me</em>." The celebrated
comedian, Shuter, had a great personal regard for Mr.
Whitefield, and not unfrequently attended his ministry.
At one period of his popularity he was acting
in a drama under the character of <em>Ramble</em>. During
the run of the performance, he attended service at
Tottenham Court chapel, and was seated in a pew
exactly opposite the pulpit. Mr. Whitefield on that
occasion gave full vent to his feelings, and in his own
energetic manner invited sinners to the Saviour.
While doing this, fixing his eye full on Shuter, he
added, "And thou, poor <em>Ramble</em>, who hast long rambled
from him, come also. Oh, end your rambling by
coming to Jesus." Shuter was exceedingly struck,
and going afterwards to Whitefield, he said, "I thought
I should have fainted; how could you serve me so?"</p>

<p>In the early part of 1756, Whitefield was engaged
in London, preaching and collecting for the poor not
only at Bethesda, but also for the French Protestants.
At the Tabernacle, a man came up to him in the pulpit,
threatening his life, and handing him three anonymous
letters denouncing sudden and certain death, unless
he ceased to preach and to pursue the offenders by
law. One of these letters Whitefield sent to the government,
who at once offered a reward, and his majesty's
pardon, to any one who would discover the
writer. While this fact gratified, it also embarrassed
him. He wrote to Lady Huntingdon, "My greatest
distress is to act so as to avoid rashness on the one
hand, and timidity on the other." For his own sake,
he would not have cared about the matter; but looking
at it as connected with the cause of civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
religious freedom, he wisely allowed the law to take
its course at the hazard of his own life by assassination.
Agreeably with the advice of the government,
he carried the whole affair into the court of the King's
Bench; this alarmed the offenders, and the annoyance
ceased.</p>

<p>We next find him at Bristol, but not to rest, though
the labors and anxieties of the winter and spring had
nearly worn out his strength and spirits. Here he
preached as usual, and then returned to London.
During this journey he preached in several places in
Gloucestershire, his native county, and in Bradford,
Frome, Warminster, and Portsmouth, spending about
three months in the tour.</p>

<p>In the county which gave Whitefield birth, is still
to be seen a chair on which he often sat, and on which
may be yet read the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"If love of souls should e'er be wanting here,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Remember me, for I am Whitefield's chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I bore his weight, was witness to his fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His earnest prayers, his interesting tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His holy soul was fired with love divine:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If thine be such, sit down and call me <em>thine</em>."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>A very few weeks passed, and we find him in
Kent. In a letter written July 27, after his visit to
that county, he says, "The gospel flourishes in London.
I am just returned from preaching at Sheerness,
Chatham, and in the camp." On the next day he set
off towards Scotland. On August 14, he writes from
Sunderland, "How swiftly doth my precious time pass
away! It is now a fortnight since I came to Leeds,
in and about which I preached eight days, thrice
almost every day, to thronged and affected auditories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
On Sunday last at Bradford, in the morning, the auditory
consisted of about ten thousand; at noon and in
the evening, at Birstal, to nearly double the number.
Though hoarse, I was helped to speak so that all
heard. Next morning I took a sorrowful leave of
Leeds, preached at Doncaster at noon, and at York
the same night. On Wednesday, at Warstall, about
fifty miles off; on Thursday, twice at Yarm; and last
night and this morning, here." Wherever he labored,
he heard of the good effects of his preaching in those
places last year, and was constantly finding "many
trophies of redeeming love." Such was the effect of
the two sermons he preached at Birstal, that "several
hundreds rode eight miles with him in the evening,
singing and praising God."</p>

<p>In a day or two after this, we find him at Edinburgh
and Glasgow, preaching, as usual, to vast
crowds, and with his accustomed success. At the
former places especially, even politicians gave him a
cordial welcome, and thronged to hear him, while the
newspapers applauded him for his spirit-stirring exposures
of "Popish tyranny and arbitrary power."
He preached twice every day in the Orphan-hospital
park, and blended with almost every sermon rousing
appeals to the Protestantism, courage, and loyalty of
the Scotch. At the close of one of his sermons he
pleaded the cause of the poor Highlanders, and collected
at its close about three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>On his way back to London, Whitefield held a
peculiarly solemn and refreshing meeting with his
friends at Leeds; and after it, he braced his nerves
by a tour of <em>mountain preaching</em> in company with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
friend Grimshaw. But it was now late in October,
and as he found "these cold countries bringing on his
last year's disorder," and having, as he significantly
says, "grown very prudent," he returned to London,
and dedicated Tottenham Court-road church edifice.
Another errand also had taken him to that city. The
new governor of Georgia had sent for him, to consult
with him before sailing to that colony. Whitefield
met him, and was so much delighted with him,
that he wrote off to Bethesda to prepare them for a
<em>state</em> visit. He says, "Waited upon his excellency,
and gave him, and all whom he pleases to bring, an
invitation to Bethesda. Dear Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; will make
proper provision." He went even farther, and proposed
that the governor, if possible, should be received
at Bethesda with military honors.</p>

<p>The success of his new house of worship in Tottenham
Court-road showed the necessity and propriety
of its erection on that spot. Several persons
of distinction came, and engaged permanent seats;
and the place was often so crowded, that hundreds
were unable to obtain admission. It was now usual
with him to preach about fifteen times every week,
which, with a weak appetite, want of rest, and much
care upon his mind, greatly enfeebled him. He writes,
"But the joy of the Lord is my strength; and my
greatest grief is, that I can do no more for Him who
hath done and suffered so much for me."</p>

<p>In the following year, 1757, Whitefield planned
another journey to Scotland, at the time the general
assembly of the church was held. Before leaving
London, he had placed the affairs of his projected college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
in the hands of Lord Halifax, and he now seems
to have hoped that this journey to Scotland would
have promoted that object, as well as others. It is
said, that about a hundred ministers at a time attended
his sermons, thirty of whom invited him to a public
entertainment. Lord Cathcart, his majesty's commissioner
to the assembly, also invited him to his own
table. Whitefield says that he preached "just fifty
times" on this visit, which extended to about a month.</p>

<p>From Scotland he went, in June, as we have seen,
to Ireland, and enjoyed, in the midst of no small persecution,
much preaching, and much success. On his
return to London, he found that the governor of Georgia
had visited Bethesda, and promised to communicate
his sentiments to Lord Halifax, "concerning its
being enlarged into a college;" but the pressure of
public affairs hindered his application to the government.
Bad news arrived from America, "about the
fleet," and therefore Whitefield kept a fast-day at his
houses of worship.</p>

<p>The health of our evangelist now sadly failed. He
was brought to live on the "short allowance of preaching
but once a day, and thrice on the Sunday;" very
"short allowance" for <em>him</em>. Once, however, he broke
through the restraint, and preached three times on
the success of the king of Prussia; which, he says,
"somewhat <em>recovered</em>" him, after he had been for a
week at the gates of the grave. He was not able this
winter to attempt what he considered great things;
but Tottenham Court was his <em>Bethel</em>, as he called it.
This house was then surrounded by a beautiful piece
of ground, and he formed the plan of building on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
an almshouse for "twelve godly widows," as a "standing
monument that the Methodists were not against
good works." This charity he soon carried into
effect. His thoughts, however, were not confined to
home. Although broken down in health and spirits,
by weakness and want of rest, he watched the affairs
of Prussia with intense interest, and assured the German
Protestants, through Professor Francke, that "we
looked on their distresses as our own."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1758, he laid the foundation-stone
of his almshouse, and in June of the same year began
to select its inmates. Pointing to these houses, some
years afterwards, he said to a gentleman who was
visiting him, "Those are my redoubts. The prayers
of the poor women who reside in them, protect me in
my house." Having arranged for the supply of his
London pulpits, Whitefield went into the west of England,
and proceeded from thence into Wales. But
his health was so feeble, that he could not bear to
drive, nor even ride in a one-horse chaise. The roads
were rough, and riding shook him nearly to pieces.
"Every thing," he says, "wearies this shattered bark
now." A friend purchased for him a close chaise,
advancing the money until he could conveniently
repay it. He deeply felt this kindness, because by no
other means could he have itinerated. "I would not,"
he says, "lay out a single farthing but for my blessed
Master; but it is inconceivable what I have undergone
these three weeks. <em>I never was so before.</em> O for
a <em>hearse</em> to carry my weary carcass to the wished for
grave." During all this tour he was unable to sit up
in company even once; yet he often preached to ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
or fifteen thousand people, and made their "tears flow
like water from the rock." His views of himself at
this time were more than usually humble. He said
to Lady Huntingdon, "Oh, I am sick&mdash;sick in body,
but infinitely more so in mind, to see so much dross
in my soul. Blessed be God, there is One who will
sit as a refiner's fire, to purify the sons of Levi. I
write out of the burning bush. Christ is there; Christ
is there!"</p>

<p>Among the many illustrations of Scripture which
Whitefield often introduced into his sermons, one is
truly worthy of record. Preaching from the words,
"Wherefore, glorify ye the Lord in the fires," Isa.
24:15, he says, "When I was, some years ago, at
Shields, I went into a glass-house, and standing very
attentively, I saw several masses of burning glass of
various forms. The workman took one piece of glass,
and put it into one furnace, then he put it into a
second, and then into a third. I asked him, 'Why do
you put that into so many fires?' He answered me,
'Oh, sir, the first was not hot enough, nor the second,
and therefore we put it into the third, and that will
make it transparent.' 'Oh,' thought I, 'does this man
put this glass into one furnace after another, that it
may be rendered perfect? Oh, my God, put me into
one furnace after another, that my soul may be transparent,
that I may see God as he is.'"</p>

<p>In the month of July, Whitefield again set out for
Scotland, preaching on his way in many pulpits, including
"Bishop Bunyan's," as he used to call him, at
Bedford, Berridge's at Everton, and Doddridge's at
Northampton. Four Episcopal clergymen lent him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
their pulpits. His health received, for some time,
little benefit, so that he sometimes feared he must
return. But he adds, "Through divine strength, I
hope to go forward; and shall strive, as much as in
me lies, to die in this glorious work." He preached
and collected in Scotland with his accustomed energy
and success, and returned to London with his health
somewhat renovated. This year he lost by death
some of his earliest and warmest friends, including
Hervey in England, and Presidents Burr and Edwards,
and Governor Belcher, in America. Such
removals gave him also "a desire to depart," but his
work on earth was not yet done.</p>

<p>Three principal facts connected with our evangelist
may be said to mark the year 1759. One was,
that he had the satisfaction to clear off all his debts
for the orphan-house. "Bethesda's God," he writes,
"lives for ever, and is faithful and all-sufficient." He
longed again to visit America, but several difficulties
intervened for the present.</p>

<p>A second event which marked the year, was
another journey to Scotland. He complains in his
letters, that though his congregations at Edinburgh
and Glasgow were never more numerous and attentive,
yet, with respect to the power of religion, it was
a dead time in Scotland, in comparison with London
and several other parts of England. His presence in
Scotland, however, at this time was very important,
especially in collecting for his orphan-house and the
Highland Society for the support of children. Many
Scottish soldiers were now in America, which greatly
increased the interest felt in every thing relating to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>In this year, 1759, Mr. Whitefield also for the first
time visited Brighthelmstone, now called Brighton, a
very fashionable watering-place, where George IV.
afterwards, while regent, built a tawdry tasteless
palace. The preacher's first sermon was delivered
under a tree in a field behind the White Lion inn.
Among his congregation on that day was a young
man named Tuppen, about eighteen years of age. He
had been educated by a pious mother in the strict
observance of the external parts of religion, but was
entirely destitute of its power. He attended not so
much from curiosity, as from the intention to insult
and interrupt the preacher. He tells us, "I had therefore
provided myself with stones in my pocket, if opportunity
offered, to pelt the preacher; but I had not
heard long, before the stone was taken out of my heart
of flesh; and then the other stones, with shame and
weeping, were dropped one by one out upon the
ground." The words, "Turn ye, turn ye," became the
means of turning him from sin to God. Mr. Tuppen
became an excellent Christian minister, and labored
as a pastor for some years in Portsmouth. He then
removed to the city of Bath, where he originated a
congregation, and built a house for public worship.
He was succeeded in this important sphere by the late
distinguished William Jay, who labored there for
about sixty-four years.</p>

<p>Such was the prosperity attendant on the efforts
of Messrs. Whitefield, Madan, Romaine, Berridge,
Venn, and Fletcher, at Brighton, that Lady Huntingdon
felt it her duty to erect a church edifice there,
and being unable to do it in any other way, sold her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
jewels to the amount of nearly three thousand five
hundred dollars. The cause still flourishes there, and
very many have been turned to righteousness.</p>

<p>While Whitefield's ministry at the Tabernacle was
at its height of popularity, Foote, a comedian of eminent
talent for mimicry, who was frequently in difficulties
on account of his love of ridicule, by which
indeed his life was shortened, employed his wit to
bring the distinguished preacher into contempt. One
of his biographers says, that "very pressing embarrassments
in his affairs compelled him to bring out his
comedy of '<cite>The Minor</cite>,' in 1760, to ridicule Methodism,
which, though successful, gave great offence, and
was at last suppressed." Of this miserable piece of
buffoonery, it may be enough to say, that Foote, and
the agents employed at the Tabernacle and Tottenham
Court-road chapel to collect materials from
Whitefield for the accomplishment of their object,
were so disgracefully ignorant of the inspired writings,
as not to know that what they took for Mr.
Whitefield's peculiar language was that of the word
of God.</p>

<p>Lady Huntingdon interposed in the matter, first
with the Lord Chamberlain, by whose license alone
any play could then be performed in London, and then
with Mr. Garrick, the latter of whom assured her that
he would use his influence to exclude it, and added,
that had he been aware of the offence it was adapted
to give, it should never have appeared with his concurrence.
The representation of this piece of mummery,
as might have been expected, considerably increased
Whitefield's popularity, and brought thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of new persons to hear the gospel: thus Providence
gave him the victory over his opposers.</p>

<p>To report the sicknesses, the labors, and the successes
of Whitefield from this time to that of his sixth
embarkation for America, would be little more than
a repetition of the past. Suffice it to say, that in England,
and in Scotland, he labored amid much ill-health,
and surrounded with many dangers; but at length,
having found an Episcopal clergyman, the Rev. John
Berridge, a man of somewhat eccentric manners, but
of great learning, of eminent piety, and of burning
zeal, who was willing to labor for a time in London,
Whitefield set sail in the ship Fanny, Captain Archibald
Galbraith, bound from Greenock to Virginia,
June 1, 1763, and arrived at Rappahannock, after a
tedious, but otherwise pleasant voyage of about twelve
weeks, in the last week of August.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>SIXTH VISIT AND LABORS IN AMERICA&mdash;RENEWED
LABORS IN GREAT BRITAIN.<br />

1763-1767.</h3></blockquote>


<p>Whitefield was now for the sixth time in America.
He was twelve weeks on the voyage; but though
tedious, it had done him good. "I enjoyed," he says,
"that quietness which I have in vain sought after for
some years on shore." Owing to the violence of his
asthma, he had set sail "with but little hopes of farther
public usefulness;" but after being six weeks at
sea, he wrote to a friend, "Who knows but our latter
end may <em>yet</em> increase? If not in public usefulness,
Lord Jesus, let it be in heart-holiness. I know who
says Amen. I add, Amen and amen."</p>

<p>On his arrival in Virginia, Whitefield was surrounded
by many Christian friends, the fruits of his
former labors in that colony, but whom he had not
hitherto known. It was with great difficulty, however,
that he preached to them; for though his general
health was better, his breathing was very bad.
The months of September, October, and November,
he spent in Philadelphia. He says, "Here are some
young bright witnesses rising up in the church. Perhaps
I have already conversed with forty <em>new creature</em>
ministers of various denominations. Sixteen popular
students, I am credibly informed, were converted in
New Jersey college last year. What an open door if
I had strength! Last Tuesday we had a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
season among the Lutherans; children and grown people
were much impressed." Ill as he was, he preached
twice a week, and with his usual success.</p>

<p>He intensely desired at this time to visit Georgia,
but was absolutely prohibited by his physicians, till
he had recovered his strength. In the end of November,
therefore, he passed over into New Jersey, visiting
the college, and Elizabethtown. He tells us that
at the college he had "four sweet seasons." His spirits
rose at the sight of the young soldiers who were
to fight when he had fallen. It was now winter, and
"cold weather and a warm heart" put him in good
spirits, so that he was able to preach three times a
week.</p>

<p>A young man, a member of the college, hearing
that Whitefield was to preach in the neighborhood,
and being more than a little anxious to ascertain
whether he really deserved all the celebrity he enjoyed,
went to hear him. The day was very rainy,
and the audience was small; the preacher, accustomed
to address thousands, did not feel his powers called
forth as at other times. After having heard about
one-third part of the sermon, the young man said to
himself, "The man is not so great a wonder after all&mdash;quite
commonplace and superficial&mdash;nothing but show,
and not a great deal of that;" and looking round upon
the audience, he saw that they appeared about as uninterested
as usual, and that old father &mdash;&mdash;, who sat
directly in front of the pulpit, and who always went
to sleep after hearing the text and plan of the sermon,
was enjoying his accustomed nap. About this time,
Whitefield stopped. His face went rapidly through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
many changes, till it looked more like a rising thunder-cloud
than any thing else; and beginning very
deliberately, he said, "If I had come to speak to you
in my own name, you might rest your elbows upon
your knees, and your heads upon your hands, and
sleep; and once in a while look up and say, 'What
does the babbler talk of?' But I have not come to
you in my own name. No; I have come to you in
the name of the Lord God of hosts, and"&mdash;here he
brought down his hand and foot at once, so as to
make the whole house ring&mdash;"and I must, and will be
heard." Every one in the house started, and old
father &mdash;&mdash; among the rest. "Aye, aye," continued
the preacher, looking at him, "I have waked you up,
have I? I meant to do it. I am not come here to
preach to stocks and stones; I have come to you in
the name of the Lord God of hosts, and I must, and I
will have an audience." The congregation was fully
aroused, and the remaining part of the sermon produced
a considerable effect.</p>

<p>From New Jersey, Whitefield passed on to New
York, where he says, "Such a flocking of all ranks I
never saw before at New York.... Prejudices have
most strangely subsided. The better sort flock as
eagerly as the common people, and are fond of coming
for private gospel conversation. Congregations continue
very large, and I trust saving impressions are
made upon many." Such also was his influence as
a philanthropist, that though prejudices ran high
against the Indians, on account of a threatened insurrection
in the south, he collected about six hundred
dollars for Dr. Wheelock's Indian school at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Lebanon, Conn., which he soon after visited with
much pleasure.</p>

<p>An extract of a letter from New York, dated Jan.
23, 1754, which appeared in the Boston Gazette, may
show the esteem in which he was held: "The Rev.
George Whitefield has spent seven weeks with us,
preaching twice a week, with more general approbation
than ever; and has been treated with great
respect by many of the gentlemen and merchants of
this place. During his stay he preached two charity
sermons, the one on the occasion of the annual collection
for the poor, in which double the sum was collected
that ever was upon the like occasion; the
other was for the benefit of Mr. Wheelock's Indian
school at Lebanon, for which he collected, notwithstanding
the present prejudices of many people against
the Indians, the sum of one hundred and twenty pounds.
In his last sermon, he took a very affectionate leave of
the people of this city, who expressed great concern
at his departure. May God restore this great and
good man, in whom the gentleman, the Christian, and
accomplished orator shine forth with such peculiar
lustre, to a perfect state of health, and continue him
long a blessing to the world and the church of Christ."</p>

<p>Leaving New York, he visited and preached, as
far as his strength would allow, at Easthampton
Bridge, Hampton, and Southhold, on Long Island; at
Shelter Island, and at New London, Norwich, and
Providence.</p>

<p>Whitefield arrived at Boston in the end of February,
1764, and was welcomed by multitudes with
cordial affection; and again he saw "the Redeemer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
stately steps in the great congregation." Boston at
that time was visited with small-pox, and Whitefield
therefore devoted much of his labor to the adjacent
towns. Writing from Concord, he says, "How would
you have been delighted to have seen Mr. Wheelock's
Indians. Such a promising nursery of future missionaries,
I believe, was never seen in New England before.
Pray encourage it with all your might." About
two months after his arrival in Boston, his illness
returned, but did not long prevent him from preaching,
and the people still flocked in crowds to hear
him. He left Boston for the south; but messengers
were sent to entreat his return, and especially urged
him to renew his six o'clock morning lecture. He
did return, but was now unable to preach at the early
hour they desired; he appeared, however, in the pulpit
for some time on three occasions in the week, and
such was the number of converts discovered, that after
he had left it was proposed to send him a book filled
with their names, as desiring his return.</p>

<p>We ought to have said, that according to the
Boston Gazette, about the time of the arrival of
Whitefield, "at a meeting of the freeholders and other
inhabitants of the town of Boston, it was unanimously
voted that the thanks of the town be given to the Rev.
George Whitefield, for his charitable care and pains
in collecting a considerable sum of money in Great
Britain for the distressed sufferers by the great fire in
Boston, 1760. A respectable committee was appointed
to wait on Mr. Whitefield, to inform him of the vote,
and present him with a copy thereof."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
friends, he left Boston in the early part of June. On
the first of that month he wrote, "Friends have even
constrained me to stay here, for fear of running into
the summer's heat. Hitherto I find the benefit of it.
Whatever it is owing to, through mercy, I am much
better in health than I was this time twelve months,
and can preach thrice a week to very large auditories
without hurt; and every day I hear of some brought
under concern. This is all of grace."</p>

<p>Sorrowfully parting from his friends at Boston,
Whitefield left them for New York by way of New
Haven. Here he preached to the students, and had
taken his leave of them; but such was the impression
he had made on their minds, that they requested the
president to go after him, to entreat for another "quarter
of an hour's exhortation." He complied with the
request, and the effect was what he called "the <em>crown</em>
of the expedition." He continued at New York till
the end of August. While there he writes, "At present
my health is better than usual, and as yet I have
felt no inconvenience from the summer's heat. I have
preached twice lately in the fields, and we sat under
the blessed Redeemer's shadow with great delight.
My late excursions upon Long Island, I trust, have
been blessed. It would surprise you to see above one
hundred carriages at every sermon in the new world."</p>

<p>On his way to Philadelphia, in September, Whitefield
preached at the New Jersey college commencement;
for which, and for the influence he had exerted
in favor of the institution, the trustees sent him a vote
of thanks. His reception at the college was all he
could desire. The governor and the ex-governor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the state, with many other gentlemen, attended, and
every other mark of respect was shown him. At
Philadelphia, he describes the effect of his labors as
"great indeed," and as usual, he was compelled to
exclaim, "Grace, grace!"</p>

<p>Leaving Pennsylvania, he went on through Virginia;
here he tells us, in places as "unlikely as <em>Rome</em>
itself," he found societies of Christians, formed and
led on by a wealthy planter of that colony; they met
him in a body, wishing publicly to identify themselves
with him. "Surely the <em>Londoners</em>," he writes, "who
are fed to the full, will not envy the poor souls in
these parts. I almost determine to come back in the
spring" from Georgia to them.</p>

<p>On one occasion, while he was preaching in this
colony, a Mr. Allen, afterwards a member of the eminent
Mr. Davies' church at Hanover, and who, with
his family, "addicted himself to the ministry of the
saints," fell on the ground at full length, suddenly, as
if shot through the heart, and lay for the remainder of
the evening as one who was dead. His descendants
are now very numerous, and many of them are among
the most zealous Christians in that state.</p>

<p>From Virginia, Whitefield proceeded to South
Carolina, and, Nov. 22, wrote, "At Newbern, last Sunday,
good impressions were made. I have met with
what they call 'New Lights' in almost every place,
and have the names of several of their preachers."
Having preached at Charleston, he passed on to Bethesda,
and had the happiness to find the whole colony
in a prosperous condition. Here he spent the
winter, and writes, "Peace and plenty reign at Bethesda.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
All things go on successfully. God hath
given me great favor in the sight of the governor,
council, and assembly. A memorial was presented for
an additional grant of lands, consisting of two thousand
acres. It was immediately complied with. Both
houses addressed the governor on behalf of the intended
college. A warm answer was given; and I am
now putting every thing in repair, and getting every
thing ready for that purpose. Every heart seems to
leap for joy at the prospect of its future usefulness to
this and the neighboring colonies. He who holdeth
the stars in his right hand will direct, in due time,
whether I shall directly embark for England, or take
one tour more to the northward. I am in delightful
winter quarters for once. His excellency dined with
me yesterday, and expressed his satisfaction in the
warmest terms. Who knows how many youths may
be trained up for the service of the ever-loving and
altogether lovely Jesus. Thus far, however, we may
set up our Ebenezer. Hitherto the bush hath been
burning, but is not consumed." To this statement he
adds, "Mr. Wright hath done much in a little time;
but he hath worked night and day, and not stirred a
mile for many weeks. Thanks be to God, all outward
things are settled on this side the water. The auditing
the accounts, and laying the foundation for a college,
hath silenced enemies and comforted friends.
The finishing of this affair confirms my call to England
at this time."</p>

<p>But the intense anxiety of multitudes to hear his
preaching, prevented Whitefield from leaving America
for several months longer. He had, indeed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
early as the middle of February, determined not to
visit New England till his return from Europe; but
arriving at Charleston, he was compelled to devote
to labors there the whole month of March, and then
set out for Philadelphia, preaching at many places on
his way. He says, "All the way from Charleston to
this place the cry is, 'For Christ's sake, stay and
preach to us.' Oh for a thousand lives to spend for
Jesus."</p>

<p>The heat of the weather made it indispensable for
his health that he should go to sea, and July 5th he
once more arrived in England, on his last return voyage
from America. He says, "We have had but a
twenty-eight days' passage. The transition has been
so sudden, that I can scarcely believe that I am in
England. I hope, ere long, to have a more sudden
transition into a better country." When he arrived
in his native land, he was ill of a nervous fever,
which left him extremely weak in body, and unable to
exert himself as formerly. Yet, still intent on his
work, he did what he could, in expectation of soon
entering into his eternal rest. "Oh, to end life well!"
he writes; "methinks I have now but one river to
pass over. And we know of One who can carry us
over without being ankle deep."</p>

<p>On Whitefield's arrival in England, he found that
his excellent friend the Countess of Huntingdon was
erecting a large and beautiful church edifice in the
fashionable city of Bath, and to that place he at once
repaired. There he found several of his clerical
brethren preaching in the private chapel at Bretby
Hall, belonging to the Earl of Chesterfield, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
placed it for the time being at the disposal of Lady
Huntingdon. On Whitefield's arrival, this place was
of necessity exchanged for the Park, where the concourse
of people was as vast as ever.</p>

<p>October 6, he preached the dedicatory sermon
of Lady Huntingdon's church at Bath, to an immense
crowd. To his friend Robert Keen, Esq., one of the
managers of his London houses, he wrote, "Could you
have come, and have been present at the opening of
the chapel, you would have been much pleased. The
building is extremely plain, and yet equally grand.
A most beautiful original! All was conducted with
great solemnity. Though a wet day, the place was
very full, and assuredly the great Shepherd and Bishop
of souls consecrated and made it holy ground by
his presence."</p>

<p>He made but a short stay at Bath, and returned
to London, still feeble and tottering, but still compelled
to labor. He had an interview with his old
friend John Wesley, who says of him, "He seemed to
be an old man, being fairly worn out in his Master's
service, though he has hardly seen fifty years; and yet
it pleases God that I, who am now in my sixty-third
year, find no disorder, no weakness, no decay, no difference
from what I was at five and twenty, only that
I have fewer teeth, and more gray hairs." Writing
to a friend at Sheerness, in Kent, Jan. 18, 1766, Whitefield
says, "I am sorry to acquaint you that it is not
in my power to comply with your request, for want of
more assistance. I am confined in town with the care
of two important posts, when I am only fit to be put
into some garrison among invalids." By some means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
however, he obtained a release, for in March we find
him at Bath and Bristol. Writing, March 17, he says,
"The uncertainty of my motions has made me slow in
writing; and a desire to be a while free from London
cares, has made me indifferent about frequent hearing
from thence. Last Friday evening, and twice yesterday,
I preached at Bath, to very thronged and brilliant
auditories."</p>

<p>Whitefield's interest in America was not lessened
by his absence from it. He ardently loved it, and
wished for the return of its peace and prosperity. He
hoped, with many others, that the repeal of the Stamp
Act would lead to this result; hence, we find in his
Letter-book this entry: "March 16, 1766, Stamp Act
repealed. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria Deo.</i>"</p>

<p>Among the remarkable men of his day was Samson
Occam. He was descended, on his mother's side,
from Uncas, chief of the Mohegans. He was born in
1723, of parents who led a wandering life, depending
on hunting and fishing for subsistence. None cultivated
their lands, all dwelt in wigwams, and Samson
was one of the very first of the tribe who learned to
read. About the year 1740, at the age of seventeen, he
was converted by the labors of Whitefield, Gilbert Tennent,
and their companions. In a year or two he had
learned to read his Bible with ease, and to his great
advantage. He was a pupil at the school originally
founded by Dr. Wheelock, at Lebanon, Conn., for the
benefit exclusively of Indians, four years, and was
then a teacher for eleven years. In 1759, he was ordained
by the Suffolk Presbytery, and became an eminently
zealous preacher to the scattered Mohegans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
In 1766, in company with the Rev. Mr. Whitaker of
Norwich, he went to England to advocate the cause
of Dr. Wheelock's Indian school, which school was
afterwards merged in Dartmouth college, of which
Mr. Wheelock was also founder and first president.
Occum preached in the churches of Whitefield and
Lady Huntingdon, as well as in some others of different
denominations. We remember half a century ago
hearing an old lady at Kidderminster, the town of
Richard Baxter, describe a scene which occurred in
Fawcett's church in that town. Occum had preached,
and a handsome collection had been taken for his
object; with tears of gratitude and joy the good man
thanked them, and in tones which neither the weeping
nor the mimetic talent of the old lady would allow
her fully to imitate, assured them that the blessing of
many ready to perish would come upon them. The
place was a Bochim, and nothing could prevent the
people from having the plates again carried round,
that they might add to the liberal contributions they
had already made.</p>

<p>Occum preached in Great Britain from three to
four hundred sermons; and as no North American
Indian had ever preached in England before, public
curiosity was great, and his pecuniary success considerable.
He brought to this country, with his companion,
as the produce of their labors, more than forty-five
thousand dollars. In 1772 he published an interesting
sermon which he preached to an Indian at his
execution. An excellent portrait of him was published
in England.</p>

<p>Dr. Timothy Dwight writes, "I heard Mr. Occum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
twice. His discourses, though not proofs of superior
talents, were decent; and his utterance in some degree
eloquent. His character at one time labored under
some imputations; yet there is good reason to believe
that most, if not all of them were unfounded; and
there is satisfactory evidence that he was a man of
piety." An account of the Montauk Indians, written
by Occum, is preserved in the "Historical Collections."
He died at New Stockbridge, N. Y., July,
1792. It has been said that the first Sunday-school
in these United States was founded in the house of
his sister, a few months after his death.</p>

<p>Occum was somewhat of a wit, and could well
apply his talent in his conflict with the enemies of divine
truth. He once ended a long controversial conversation
with a Universalist, by saying, "Well, well,
remember, if you are correct, I am safe; if you are not
correct, I am safe. I have two strings to my bow;
you have but one."</p>

<p>In June, 1766, we again find Whitefield in the
neighborhood of Bristol, whence he writes, "As my
feverish heat continues, and the weather is too wet to
travel, I have complied with the advice of friends,
and have commenced a Hot-wells water drinker twice
a day. However, twice this week, at six o'clock in
the morning, I have been enabled to call thirsty souls
to come and 'drink of the water of life freely.' Tomorrow
evening, God willing, the call is to be repeated,
and again on Sunday." On his return to London,
he writes, under date of September 25, "Many in this
metropolis seem to be on the wing for God; the shout
of a king is yet heard in the Methodist camp. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
I wings, I would gladly fly from pole to pole; but
they are clipped by thirty years' feeble labors. Twice
or thrice a week I am permitted to ascend my gospel
throne. The love of Christ, I am persuaded, will
constrain you to pray that the last glimmering of an
expiring taper may be blessed to the guiding of many,
wandering souls to the Lamb of God."</p>

<p>The good providence of God now gave Whitefield
a colleague in the ministry at the Tabernacle and
Tottenham Court-road chapel, the Rev. Torial Joss.
This gentleman had spent many years as captain at
sea; converted by divine grace, and filled with holy
zeal, he devoted his popular talents to the welfare of
his fellow-men, preaching both on sea and land. In a
remarkable manner, Mr. Whitefield became acquainted
with him, and, without his knowledge, published
that he would preach in his houses of worship, which,
though with extreme reluctance, Joss did. These
services were often renewed, and Whitefield gave him
no rest till he abandoned the sea, and devoted himself
to the ministry. Everywhere he was popular, and
everywhere useful. He continued minister of the two
places in London&mdash;spending four or five months in
each year travelling and preaching&mdash;for twenty-seven
years after the death of his friend, and then departed
from earth, in 1797, in holy triumph, in the 66th year
of his age.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary men in modern
times was the late Rev. Rowland Hill, who erected
Surrey chapel, London, and continued to preach in it
till his death, in his eighty-ninth year, in 1833. He
was eminently dignified in person, possessed extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
zeal, and was honored by his great Master
with probably more success in the direct work of saving
souls than any other minister of his day. He
was a man of considerable rank, his father being a
gentleman of title, one of his brothers a member of
Parliament for many years, representing his native
county, and the late eminent statesman and soldier
Lord Hill was his nephew. Mr. Hill himself in early
life became a Christian, and was educated for the
ministry in the established church, but violated its
rules, and preached wherever he could; for many
years he was greatly persecuted by his own family,
some of whom, however, in the end sustained the yoke
of Christ. When Rowland began his somewhat erratic
career, the opposition from his father was so
great, that he was reduced sometimes to extreme poverty;
and he was exactly the man to be encouraged
by such men as Whitefield and Berridge. We give a
few extracts from letters addressed to him by Whitefield,
which certainly show no small degree of ardor,
though we cannot see in them what Hill's clerical
biographer, Mr. Sidney, professed to find, "an aspiration
after the honors, when he had no prospect of
the sufferings of martyrdom." The fact was, that
Mr. Sidney was offended with Whitefield, as he was
with his venerable uncle, Mr. Hill, for having deviated
from the rigid laws of the establishment. It is only
needful to introduce the first letter by saying that it
was dated, London, December 27, 1766, and was sent
in answer to one in which Mr. Hill had asked his
counsel.</p>

<p>"About thirty-four years ago, the master of Pembroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
college, where I was educated, took me to task
for visiting the sick and going to the prisons. In my
haste I said, 'Sir, if it displeaseth you I will go no
more.' My heart smote me immediately; I repented,
and went again; he heard of it&mdash;threatened&mdash;but for
fear he should be looked on as a persecutor, let me
alone. The hearts of all are in the Redeemer's hands.
I would not have you give way; no, not for a moment.
The storm is too great to hold long. Visiting
the sick and imprisoned, and instructing the ignorant,
are the very vitals of true and undefiled religion. If
threatened, denied degree, or expelled <em>for this</em>, it will
be the best degree you can take&mdash;a glorious preparative
for, and a blessed presage of future usefulness.
I have seen the dreadful consequences of giving way
and looking back. How many by this wretched cowardice,
and fear of the cross, have been turned into
pillars, not of useful, but of useless salt. Now is your
time to prove the strength of Jesus yours. If opposition
did not so much abound, your consolations would
not so abound. Blind as he is, Satan sees some great
good coming on. We never prospered so much at
Oxford as when we were hissed at and reproached as
we walked along the streets, as being counted the
dung and offscouring of all things. That is a poor
building which a little stinking breath of Satan's vassals
can throw down. Your house, I trust, is better
founded. Is it not built upon a rock? Is not that
rock the blessed Jesus? The gates of hell, therefore,
shall not be able to prevail against it. Go on, therefore,
my dear man, go on. Old Berridge, I believe,
would give you the same advice; you are honored in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
sharing his reproach and name. God be praised that
you are enabled to bless when others blaspheme. God
bless and direct and support you. He will, he will.
Good Lady Huntingdon is in town; she will rejoice to
hear that you are under the cross. You will not want
her prayers, or the poor prayers of, my dear honest
young friend, yours, in an all-conquering Jesus."</p>

<p>The opposition Mr. Hill met with from his parents
increased, and the threat of his degree being
withheld, was, on the part of the university authorities,
more determined; still, however, he persevered
in his preaching and his visits, in violation of the laws
of discipline. In June, 1767, Mr. Whitefield wrote
him: "I wish you joy of the late high dignity conferred
upon you&mdash;higher than if you were made the
greatest professor in the university of Cambridge.
The honorable degrees you intend giving to your
promising candidates, [allowing some of his fellow-students
to preach in the various places which he had
visited,] I trust will excite a holy ambition, and a
holy emulation; let me know who is first honored.
As I have been admitted to the degree of doctor for
near these thirty years, I assure you I like my field
preferment, my airy pluralities, exceedingly well.
For these three weeks last past I have been beating up
for fresh recruits in Gloucestershire and South Wales.
Thousands and thousands attended, and good Lady
Huntingdon was present at one of our reviews. Her
ladyship's aid-de-camp preached in Brecknock-street,
and Captain Scott, that glorious field-officer, lately
fixed up his standard upon dear Mr. Fletcher's horseblock
at Madeley. Being invited thither, I have a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
inclination to lift up the Redeemer's ensign next week
in the same place; with what success, you and your
dearly beloved candidates for good old methodistical
contempt shall know hereafter. God willing, I intend
fighting my way up to town. Soon after my arrival
there, I hope thousands and thousands of volleys of
prayers, energetic, effectual, fervent, heaven-besieging,
heaven-opening, heaven-taking prayers, shall be poured
forth for you all. Oh, my dearly beloved and longed-for
in the Lord, my bowels yearn towards you. Fear
not to go without the camp; keep open the correspondence
between the two universities. Remember the
praying legions&mdash;they were never known to yield.
God bless those that are gone to their respective
<em>cures</em>&mdash;I say not <em>livings</em>, a term of too modern date.
Christ is our life; Christ is the Levite's inheritance,
and Christ will be the true disinterested Levite's lot
and portion and all. Greet your dear young companions
whom I saw; they are welcome to write
when they please. God be your physician under your
bodily malady. A thorn, a thorn! but Christ's grace
will be sufficient for you. To his tender, never-failing
mercy I commit you."</p>

<p>A few weeks after this, Mr. Hill was much depressed
in spirits, partly from bodily illness, partly
because he was about to leave Cambridge and its surrounding
villages, where he had latterly so frequently
preached, but chiefly from the fact that he was going
home, where he would again meet the frowns of his
honored parents, for what they deemed his overrighteousness.
In the midst of all this, however, he knew
that he would meet at Hawkstone, his father's residence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the cordial welcome of his sister and elder
brother, Richard Hill, afterwards a baronet. This
gentleman had lately become a village preacher and a
visitor of prisons, like his brother. Under these circumstances
he was addressed by Whitefield, in his
own peculiar and energetic style: "What said our
Lord to Martha? 'Did I not say unto thee, If thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?'
Blessed, for ever blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, for what he hath done for your
dear brother. A preaching, prison-preaching, field-preaching
<em>esquire</em>, strikes more than all the black
gowns and lawn sleeves in the world. And if I am
not mistaken, the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls
will let the world, and his own children too, know
that he will not be prescribed to in respect to men,
or garbs, or places; much less will he be confined to
any order or set of men under heaven. I wish you
both much, very much prosperity. You will have it&mdash;<em>you
will have it</em>. This is the way, walk ye in it. Both
Tabernacle and [Tottenham Court-road] chapel pulpits
shall be open to a captain or an esquire sent of
God. The good news from Oxford is encouraging.
Say what they will, preaching should be one part of
the education of a student in divinity. I pray for
you night and day."</p>

<p>On the arrival of Mr. Hill at his father's beautiful
seat, it was his happiness to find that his brother
Brian, afterwards useful as a clergyman, was added
to the number of believers in Christ; he learned also,
that one of his college friends had been threatened to
have an exhibition, or yearly gift towards his university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
expenses, withdrawn, unless he renounced his evangelical
doctrines and practices. The reader will now
understand Mr. Whitefield's letter: "I have been
sadly hindered from answering your last letter, delivered
to me by your brother. I gave it him to read,
and we had, I trust, a profitable conference. God be
praised if another of your brothers is gained. What
grace is this! Four or five out of one family&mdash;it is
scarcely to be paralleled. Who knows but the root,
as well as the branches, may be taken by and by?
Abba, Father, all things are possible with thee!
Steadiness and perseverance in the children will be
one of the best means, under God, of convincing the
parents. This present opposition I think cannot last
very long; if it does, to obey God rather than man,
when forbidden to do what is undoubted duty, is the
invariable rule. Our dear Penty [afterwards the
Rev. Thomas Pentycross] is under the cross at Cambridge.
But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Satan thwarts, and men object,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet the thing they thwart effect.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="noindent">I should be glad if any one's exhibition was taken
from him for visiting the sick, etc. It would vastly
tend to the furtherance of the gospel; but Satan sees
too far, I imagine, to play such a game now. Let
him do his work; he is only a mastiff chained. Continue
to inform me how he barks, and how far he is
permitted to go in your parts; and God's people
shall be more stirred up to pray for you all."</div>

<p>The close of Mr. Hill's life was truly interesting
and instructive. As has been intimated, he preached
with scarcely diminished power until within a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
weeks of his death. During the last two or three
years of his life he very frequently repeated the following
lines of an old poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i10">"And when I'm to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Receive me, I'll cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">But this I can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">We two are so joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he'll not be in glory, and leave me behind."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"The last time he occupied my pulpit," writes his
neighbor, the Rev. George Clayton, "when he preached
excellently for an hour, in behalf of a charitable
institution, he retired to the vestry after service under
feelings of great and manifest exhaustion. Here he
remained until every individual except the pew-openers,
his servant, and myself had left the place. At
length he seemed with some reluctance to summon
energy enough to take his departure, intimating that
it was in all probability the last time he should preach
in Walworth. His servant went before to open the
carriage-door, the pew-openers remaining in the vestry.
I offered my arm, which he declined, and then
followed him as he passed down the aisle of the
chapel. The lights were nearly extinguished, the
silence was profound, nothing indeed was heard but
the slow majestic tread of his own footsteps, when, in
an undertone, he thus soliloquized:</p>

<p class="center">
"'And when I'm to die,' etc.<br />
</p>

<p>To my heart this was a scene of unequalled solemnity,
nor can I ever recur to it without a revival of that
hallowed, sacred, shuddering sympathy which it originally
awakened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>When the good old saint lay literally dying, and
when apparently unconscious, a friend put his mouth
close to his ear, and repeated slowly his favorite lines:</p>

<p class="center">
"And when I'm to die," etc.
</p>

<p>The light came back to his fast-fading eye, a smile
overspread his face, and his lips moved in the ineffectual
attempt to articulate the words. This was the
last sign of consciousness which he gave.</p>

<p>We could almost wish that every disciple of Christ
would commit these lines, quaint as they are, to memory,
and weave them into the web of his Christian
experience. Confidence in Christ, and undeviating
adherence to him, can alone enable us to triumph in
life and death.</p>

<p>In November, 1766, Whitefield again visited Bath
and Bristol, and then passed on to Gloucestershire
and Oxford. Never did so many of the nobility attend
his ministry as he now saw at Bath, and the results of
his whole journey were such as to fill him with the
most devout gratitude. He saw too the number of
his clerical friends largely increasing, and especially
rejoiced in the fact that the excellent Fletcher, of
Madeley, preached in his pulpits in London. He writes
of this event, "Dear Mr. Fletcher has become a <em>scandalous</em>
Tottenham Court preacher.... Were we
more scandalous, more good would be done....
Still, 'the shout of a king is yet heard' in the Methodist
camp."</p>

<p>In January, 1767, Whitefield wrote a recommendatory
preface to the works of John Bunyan, whom he
pleasantly designated, "Bishop Bunyan;" and as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
as the weather would permit, we find him at Norwich,
and then at Rodborough, Woodstock, Gloucester,
and Haverfordwest, from which last place he wrote,
"Thousands and thousands attend by eight in the
morning. Life and light seem to fly all around." On
a second visit to Gloucester on this tour, he wrote,
"Blessed be God, I have got on this side the Welsh
mountains. Blessed be God, I have been on the other
side. What a scene last Sunday! What a cry for
more of the bread of life! But I was quite worn
down."</p>

<p>In September following, he again visited the north
of England, writing from day to day in high spirits.
September 28, he says, "My body feels much fatigued
in travelling; comforts in the soul overbalance;" and
from Leeds, October 3, he writes, "Field and street
preaching have rather bettered than hurt my bodily
health."</p>

<p>Whitefield now returned to London, to sustain a
heavy disappointment. The negotiations relative to
the college at Bethesda were this winter brought to an
issue. A memorial addressed to his Majesty was put
into the hands of the clerk of the Privy Council, setting
forth the great utility of a college in that place
to the southern provinces; and praying that a charter
might be granted upon the plan of the college in New
Jersey. This memorial was transmitted by the clerk
of the Privy Council to the lord president, and by his
lordship referred to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
to whom also a draft of an intended charter was presented
by the Earl of Dartmouth. A correspondence
followed all this between the archbishop and Whitefield;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the consequence of which was, that his grace
gave the draft of the college to the lord president,
who promised he would consider of it; and gave it as
his opinion that "the head of the college ought to be
a member of the church of England; that this was a
qualification not to be dispensed with; and also, that
the public prayers should not be extempore ones, but
the liturgy of the church, or some other settled and
established form." Whitefield replied that these restrictions
he could by no means agree to, because the
greatest part of the contributions for the orphan-house
came from Protestant dissenters; and because he had
constantly declared that the intended college should
be founded upon a broad foundation, and no other.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "I judged I was sufficiently warranted
to do, from the known, long-established, mild,
and uncoercive genius of the British government; also
from your grace's moderation towards Protestant dissenters;
from the unconquerable attachment of the
Americans to toleration principles, as well as from
the avowed habitual feelings of my own heart. This
being the case, and as your grace, by your silence,
seems to be like-minded with the lord president; and
as your grace's and his lordship's influence will undoubtedly
extend itself to others, I would beg leave,
after returning all due acknowledgments, to inform
your grace that I intend troubling your grace and his
lordship no more about this so long depending concern.
As it hath pleased the great Head of the
church in some degree to renew my bodily strength,
I propose now to renew my feeble efforts, and to turn
the charity into a more generous, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
into a more useful channel. I have no ambition to
be looked upon as the founder of a college; but I
would fain act the part of an honest man, a disinterested
minister of Jesus Christ, and a true, catholic,
moderate presbyter of the church of England."</p>

<p>Thus ended Whitefield's labors to establish a college
at Bethesda. Berridge, and not a few others of
his friends rather rejoiced in his disappointment, as
they thought there was some fear, uncontrolled as the
institution might hereafter be by men of established
principles of piety, that an unconverted ministry might
be increased by its means.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>HIS LAST LABORS IN GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;COLLEGE
AT TREVECCA&mdash;EARL OF BUCHAN&mdash;TUNBRIDGE
WELLS.<br />

1767-1769.</h3></blockquote>


<p>Whitefield had abandoned the idea of a charter
for a college at present, but he was yet ardently desirous
of a public academy being added to his orphan-house,
similar to what existed at Philadelphia before
a college charter was granted. He thought that if
this could be done, a better day might arrive, when a
charter on broad principles might be obtained. He
developed his whole plan in a letter to Governor
Wright. Feeling too the uncertainty of life, he wrote
to his friend Mr. Keen, "None but God knows what a
concern is upon me now, in respect of Bethesda. As
another voyage, perhaps, may be the issue and the
result of all at last, I would beg you and my dear
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; to let me have all my papers and letters,
that I may revise and dispose of them in a proper
manner. This can do no hurt, come life or come
death."</p>

<p>October 28th, 1767, Whitefield preached at the London
Tabernacle before the society for promoting religious
knowledge among the poor, usually called, The
Book Society. This society had been organized seventeen
years before this period, and included in it such
men as Watts, Doddridge, and Gifford. He gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
way to all the zeal of his heart while he discussed the
petition, "Thy kingdom come." Luke 11:2. The
congregation was immense, many had to go away
unable to obtain admittance. It was believed that a
larger number of dissenting ministers were present
than ever before heard a sermon from an Episcopal
minister, and the collection reached more than five
hundred dollars, or above four times the usual amount,
besides eighty new annual subscribers. After the
service, he dined with a very large party, including the
ministers, where harmony reigned, and much respect
was shown him.</p>

<p>It may be readily supposed, that with advancing
years and increasing experience, some changes might
have taken place both in the style and manner of
Whitefield's preaching. The Rev. Cornelius Winter,
who had become somewhat closely associated with him,
says, "He dealt more in the explanatory and doctrinal
mode on the Sabbath morning than at any other time,
and sometimes made a little, but by no means an improper
show of learning. His afternoon sermon was
more general and exhortatory. In the evening, he
drew his bow at a venture; vindicated the doctrines
of grace, fenced them with articles and homilies, referred
to the martyr's seal, and exemplified the power of
divine grace by quotations from the venerable Foxe.
Sinners were then closely plied, numbers of whom,
from curiosity, coming to hear for a minute or two,
were often compelled to hear the whole sermon. How
many in the judgment-day will rise to prove that they
heard to the salvation of the soul. Upon the members
of society, the practice of Christianity was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
usually inculcated, not without some pertinent anecdote
of a character worthy to be held up for an example,
and in whose conduct the hints recommended
were exemplified. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
and Thursdays, he preached at six in the morning;
and never, perhaps, did he preach greater sermons
than at this hour." This, with the frequent
administration of the Lord's supper to hundreds of
communicants, was his usual plan for several years;
but now he became more colloquial in his style, with
but little action; he gave pertinent expositions of the
Scriptures, with striking remarks, all comprehended
within an hour. Winter adds, "The peculiar talents
he possessed, subservient to great usefulness, can be
but faintly conceived from his sermons in print;
though, as formerly, God has made the reading of
them useful, and I have no doubt that in future they
will have their use."</p>

<p>But even yet our evangelist had to engage in war.
The opposition of the universities in Oxford and Cambridge
to the principles and practices introduced by
Whitefield, Wesley, and their companions, grew and
strengthened, till an event occurred at Oxford singularly
remarkable in its history for opposition to evangelical
religion, which for many years continued to
excite very extraordinary interest. The London "St.
James' Chronicle," of Thursday, March 17, 1763, contained
the following "extract of a letter from Oxford:"
"On Friday last, six students, belonging to Edmund
Hall, were expelled the university, after a hearing of
several hours before Mr. Vice-Chancellor and some
of the heads of houses, for holding methodistical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
tenets, and taking upon them to pray, read, and expound
the Scriptures, and singing hymns in a private
house. The &mdash;&mdash; of the &mdash;&mdash; [The Principal of the
Edmund Hall, Rev. Dr. Dixon] defended their doctrines
from the Thirty-nine Articles of the established
church, and spoke in the highest terms of the piety
and exemplariness of their lives; but his motion was
overruled, and sentence pronounced against them.
Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, [Dixon,] one of the heads of houses present,
observed, that as these six gentlemen were expelled for
having too much religion, it would be very proper to
inquire into the conduct of some who had too little;
and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; [Dr. Nowell] was heard to tell their
chief accuser, that the university was much obliged to
him for his good work."</p>

<p>To detail the events which followed this extraordinary
act, and to describe the excitement thus created,
form no part of the design of our volume.
We have referred to the fact because Mr. Whitefield
and his friend Sir Richard Hill took part in the controversy.
Referring to Dr. Nowell's assertion to
Mr. Higson, their "chief accuser," and who was also
their tutor, that the university was obliged to him,
Whitefield says to the Vice-Chancellor, "What thanks,
reverend sir, he may meet with from the whole university
I know not; but one thing I know, namely,
that he will receive no thanks for that day's work
from the innumerable company of angels, the general
assembly of the first-born which are written in heaven,
or from God the Judge of all, in that day when
Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant shall come in
his own glory, in the glory of the Father and his holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
angels, and gather his elect from all the four corners
of the world.</p>

<p>"It is true, indeed, one article of impeachment
was, that 'some of them were of <em>trades</em> before they
entered into the university.' But what evil or crime
worthy of expulsion can there be in that? To be
called from any, though the meanest mechanical employment,
to the study of the liberal arts, where a
natural genius hath been given, was never yet looked
upon as a reproach to, or diminution of any great and
public character whatsoever. Profane history affords
us a variety of examples of the greatest heroes, who
have been fetched even from the plough to command
armies, and who performed the greatest exploits for
their country's good. And if we examine <em>sacred</em> history,
we shall find that even David, after he was
anointed king, looked back with sweet complacency
to the rock from whence he was hewn, and is not
ashamed to leave it upon record, that God took him
away from the sheepfolds, as he was following the
ewes great with young; and, as though he loved to
repeat it, he took him, he says, 'that he might feed
Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.'</p>

<p>"But why speak I of David, when Jesus of Nazareth,
David's Lord and David's King, had for his
reputed father a carpenter? and in all probability,
as it was a common proverb among the Jews, that 'he
who did not teach his son a trade, taught him to be a
thief,' he worked at the trade of a carpenter himself.
For this, indeed, he was reproached and maligned:
'Is not this,' said they, 'the carpenter's son?' Nay,
'Is not this the carpenter?' But who were these maligners?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
The greatest enemies to the power of godliness
which the world ever saw, the scribes and Pharisees,
that 'generation of vipers,' as John the Baptist
calls them, who, upon every occasion, were spitting
out their venom, and shooting their arrows, even bitter
words, against that Son of man, even that Son of
God who, to display his sovereignty, and confound
the wisdom of the worldly wise, chose poor fishermen
to be his apostles; and whose chief of the apostles,
though brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, both before
and after his call to the apostleship, labored with
his own hands, and worked at the trade of a tent-maker."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know that the young men thus
expelled became useful in the church of Christ. One
of them, indeed, Erasmus Middleton, who had been
sustained at Oxford by Mr. Fuller, a dissenter and
banker in London, was ordained in Ireland by the
bishop of Down, and having married a lady of the
ducal family of Gordon, in Scotland, was curate successively
to the Rev. Messrs. Romaine and Cadogan
in London, and finally rector of Turvey, in Bedfordshire,
where he was the immediate predecessor of the
sainted Legh Richmond.</p>

<p>Many delightful evidences yet exist that as Whitefield
drew nearer the end of his career on earth, his
holy zeal increased, rather than lessened. We have
lying before us three of his letters, not included either
in the collection of his printed correspondence, or in
the lives which have been published. The first was
addressed to a gentleman at Wisbeach, and appears
to have been written from London. It is dated Sept.
25, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;As your letter breathes the spirit of
a sincere follower of the Lamb of God, I am sorry
that it hath lain by so long unanswered; but bodily
weakness, and a multiplicity of correspondents, both
from abroad and at home, must be pleaded as excuses.
'Blessed be God, our salvation is nearer than when
we believed.' It should seem that you have now
served three apprenticeships in Christ's school, and
yet I suppose the language of your heart is, 'I love
my Master, and will not go from him;' and Oh, what
a mercy, that whom Jesus loves, he loves to the end!
Do you not begin to long to see him more than ever?
Do you not groan in this tabernacle, being burdened?
Courage, courage; he that cometh will come, and will
not tarry. Oh that patience may have its perfect
work! Many in this metropolis seem to be on the
wing for God; the shout of a king is yet heard in
the Methodist camp. Had I wings, I would gladly
fly from pole to pole; but they are clipped by thirty
years' feeble labors. Twice or thrice a week I am
permitted to ascend my gospel throne. The love of
Christ, I am persuaded, will constrain you to pray
that the last glimmering of an expiring taper may
be blessed to the guiding of many wandering souls to
the Lamb of God."</p>

<p>The second letter was written from the same city,
February 12, in the following year, and was addressed
to Captain Scott, a military officer then "quartered
at Leicester." This gentleman, in early life, had been
much devoted to the gayeties of fashionable society;
long after he had entered the army, he was converted
to God, under the ministry of the Rev. W. Romaine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
and a few weeks before Mr. Whitefield addressed to
him this letter, he had begun to preach the grand message
of reconciliation. He afterwards left the army,
was ordained as a Congregational minister, and labored
for many years in almost innumerable places
in city and country, with abundant success.</p>

<p>"What, not answer so modest a request, namely,
to snatch a few moments to send dear Captain Scott
a few lines? God forbid. I must again welcome him
into the field of battle. I must again entreat him to
keep his rank as captain, and not suffer any persuasions
to influence him to descend to the low degree of
a common soldier. If God will choose a red-coat
preacher, who shall say unto him, 'What doest thou?'</p>

much prosperity. Pray write to her at Brighthelmstone,

<p class="sig">
"G. WHITEFIELD."
</p>

<p>The last letter we shall introduce in this connection
was addressed by Whitefield to the Honorable and
Rev. Walter Shirley, of Ireland, a near relative of the
Countess of Huntingdon, who breathed, as a minister
of Christ, much of the spirit of his great Master. It
was dated, Bath, Dec. 8, 1767:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and very dear Sir</span>&mdash;How glad was I to
hear by the London Shunamite, [Mrs. Herritage,] that
you and your lady were well; that God had given
you a son; that you reflected on your preaching at
Tottenham Court chapel with pleasure; that you had
gotten a curate; and, to complete all, that you intended
to visit England next spring. This news rejoiced
me before I left town, and was most grateful to our
good Lady Huntingdon, whom I have the honor of
waiting upon at this time in Bath. She hath been
sick, nigh unto death, but through mercy is now somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
recovered, though as yet unable to write much.
This her ladyship much regrets on your account; and
therefore enjoins me to inform you, that your letter
did not reach her hands till many weeks after the
proper time; that ever since she has been visited with
lingering sickness, but begs you will not linger in
coming over to our Macedonia to help us. The
thought of it seems to refresh her heaven-born soul.
Blessed be God, her ladyship still takes the lead.</p>

<p>"She is now doing honor to the remains of the
Earl of Buchan, who sweetly slept in Jesus last week.
All hath been awful, and more than awful. On Saturday
evening, before the corpse was taken from Buchan
house, a word of exhortation was given, and a
hymn sung in the room where the corpse lay. The
young Earl stood with his hands on the head of the
coffin, the Countess Dowager of Buchan on his right
hand, Lady Ann Agnes, and Lady Isabella Erskine on
his left, and their brother the Hon. Thomas Erskine
next to their mother, with Miss O&mdash;&mdash;, Miss W&mdash;&mdash;,
Miss G&mdash;&mdash;; on one side all the domestics, with a few
friends on the other. The word of exhortation was
received with great solemnity, and most wept under
the parting prayer. At ten, the corpse was removed
to good Lady Huntingdon's chapel, where it was deposited
within a place railed in for that purpose, covered
with black baize, and the usual funeral concomitants,
except escutcheons.</p>

<p>"On Sunday morning, all attended in mourning at
early sacrament. They were seated by themselves,
at the feet of the corpse, and with their head servants,
received first, and a particular address was made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
them. Immediately after receiving, these verses were
sung for them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Our lives, our blood, we here present,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If for thy truth they may be spent:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fulfil thy glorious counsel, Lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy will be done, thy name adored.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Give them thy strength, O God of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then let men rave or devils roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy faithful witnesses they'll be;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis fixed, they can do all through thee!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then they received this blessing: 'The Lord bless
you, and keep you; the Lord lift up the light of his
countenance upon you; the Lord cause his face to
shine upon you, and give you peace;' and so returned
to their places.</p>

<p>"Sacrament ended, and a blessed sacrament it was,
the noble mourners returned to the good Countess of
Huntingdon's house, which was lent them for the day.
At eleven, public worship began. The bereaved relatives
sat in order within, and the domestics round the
outside of the rail. The chapel was more than crowded.
Near three hundred tickets, signed by the present
earl, were given out to the nobility and gentry,
to be admitted. All was hushed and solemn. Proper
hymns were sung, and I preached on the words,
'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.' Attention
sat on every countenance, and deep and almost
universal impressions were made. The like scene,
and if possible more solemn, was exhibited in the
evening, and I was enabled to preach a second time,
and a like power attended the word as in the morning.
Ever since, there hath been public service and
preaching twice a day. This is to be continued till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Friday morning, then all is to be removed to Bristol,
in order to be shipped off to Scotland. The inscription
on the coffin runs thus: 'His life was honorable&mdash;his
death blessed&mdash;he sought earnestly peace with
God&mdash;he found it, with unspeakable joy, alone in the
merits of Jesus Christ, witnessed by the Holy Spirit
to his soul&mdash;he yet speaketh. Go and do likewise.'</p>

<p>"I have often wished for you here. Congregations
are very large, attentive, and deeply impressed.
Great numbers of all ranks crowd to see and hear;
and I trust many will also feel. Surely the death of
this noble earl, thus improved, will prove the life of
many. He behaved like the patriarch Jacob, when
by faith, leaning upon his staff, he blessed his children.
The earl added, 'Yea, and they shall be blessed.'
He laid his hands on, and blessed his children,
assuring them of his personal interest in Jesus. He
had great foretastes of heaven. 'Had I strength of
body,' cried he, 'I would not be ashamed, before men
and angels, to tell what the Lord Jesus hath done for
my soul. Come, Holy Ghost&mdash;come, Holy Ghost;
happy, happy, happy!' and then sweetly slept in Jesus.
All surviving relatives still feel the influence. They
sit round the corpse, attended by their domestics and
supporters, twice a day. Good Lady S&mdash;&mdash; gets
fresh spirits. The present noble earl, I believe, hath
got the blessing indeed, and seems, upon the best evidence,
to determine to know nothing but Jesus Christ,
and him crucified. He hath behaved in the most delicate
manner to the Countess, and other noble survivors."</p>

<p>The summer of 1768 brought to Whitefield a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of changes. For the last time he now visited
Edinburgh, where he found his congregations as large,
and his Christian friends as affectionate as ever. Soon
after his return to London, Mrs. Whitefield was seized
with inflammatory fever, and died, as we have already
seen, on the 9th of August. His own health too was
more than declining. He writes, "I have been in
hopes of my own departure. Through hard writing,
and frequent preaching, I have burst a vein. The
flux is in a great measure stopped; but rest and quietness
are strictly enjoined."</p>

<p>"Rest and quietness!" With Whitefield such
things were impossible as long as he could move or
speak. His fire must burn till its whole material was
expended; his heart overflowed, and he must labor
till his body sank under exhaustion. No persecution
could appall him, no sickness could long keep him
from his beloved engagements. He would preach till
he died, being fully assured that his "labor was not in
vain in the Lord."</p>

<p>Neither Whitefield nor any of his friends could
ever be the advocates of an unlearned ministry. Many
of the men engaged under his direction, and preaching
in what was already called "Lady Huntingdon's
connection," needed, as they well knew, a better education
than they possessed. Hence her ladyship obtained
a lease of an old structure, supposed to have
been part of an ancient castle erected in the reign of
Henry the Second. The date over the entrance, now
almost effaced, is 1176. It was called Trevecca
House, was situated in the parish of Talgarth, in
South Wales, and was for some time the residence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Howel Harris. This building was opened as a college
for religious and literary instruction, and the chapel
dedicated to the preaching of the everlasting gospel,
Aug. 24, 1768, the anniversary of the Bartholomew
act, and of the birth of her ladyship. Mr. Whitefield
preached from Exod. 24:24: "In all places where I
record my name, I will come unto thee and bless
thee;" and on the following Sabbath he addressed a
congregation of some thousands, who assembled in the
court before the college. His text on that occasion
was, "Other foundation can no man lay than that is
laid, which is Jesus Christ." When speaking of the
dedication of the college, Mr. Whitefield says, "What
we have seen and felt at the college is unspeakable."</p>

<p>After her ladyship's death the institution was removed
to Cheshunt, about thirteen miles north of London,
where it still flourishes under the presidency of
the Rev. Dr. W. H. Stowell.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1769, Mr. Whitefield was for
some weeks seriously ill, but towards the close of
March, he was able to write, "Through infinite mercy
I have been able to preach four days successively."
During his illness he received many offers of assistance
from his brethren in the ministry, but from none
more cordially than from the Honorable and Rev.
Mr. Shirley. Writing to him, April 1, Whitefield
says:</p>

<p>"How much am I obliged to you for your two kind
letters, and more especially for the repeated offers of
your ministerial assistance. They will be most gratefully
accepted, and, I humbly hope, be remarkably succeeded
by Him who hath promised to be with us always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
even unto the end of the world. Blessed be
His name, we have been favored with most delightful
passover feasts. The shout of the King of kings is
still heard in the midst of our Methodist camps; and
the shout of, Grace, grace! resounds from many quarters.
Our almighty Jesus knows how to build his
temple in troublous times. His work prospers in the
hands of the elect countess, who is gone to Bath, much
recovered from her late indisposition. Worthy Lady
Fanny Shirley proposes soon to follow, in order to
reside there. Some more coronets, I hear, are likely
to be laid at the Redeemer's feet. They glitter gloriously
when set in and surrounded by a <em>crown of
thorns</em>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'Subjects of the Lord, be bold;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jesus will his kingdom hold;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wheels encircling wheels must run,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each in course to bring it on.'"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>That the friendship of Dr. Franklin towards Mr.
Whitefield was sincere, cannot be doubted; there is,
however, somewhat painful in the thought, that even
in this connection Franklin could not conceal his
scepticism. In 1769 both these eminent men were in
London, and every one knows that the state of our
country was very trying. Franklin thus wrote to
Whitefield: "I am under continued apprehensions that
we may have bad news from America. The sending
soldiers to Boston always appeared to me a dangerous
step; they could do no good, they might occasion mischief.
When I consider the warm resentment of a
people who think themselves injured and oppressed,
and the common insolence of the soldiery, who are
taught to consider that people as in rebellion, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
but fear the consequences of bringing them together.
It seems like setting up a smith's forge in a
magazine of gunpowder. I <em>see</em> with you that our affairs
are not well managed by our rulers here below;
I wish I could <em>believe</em> with you, that they are well
attended to by those above: I rather suspect, from
certain circumstances, that though the general government
of the universe is well administered, our
particular little affairs are perhaps below notice,
and left to take the chance of human prudence or
imprudence, as either may happen to be uppermost.
It is, however, an uncomfortable thought, and I leave
it."</p>

<p>It would have been strange indeed if Whitefield
had allowed a letter closing in this manner to pass
without a remark; hence we are prepared to find that,
in his own handwriting, at the foot of the autograph
letter, he wrote, "<em>Uncomfortable</em> indeed! and, blessed
be God, <em>unscriptural</em>; for we are fully assured that 'the
Lord reigneth,' and are directed to cast <em>all</em> our own
care on him, because he careth for us." Could Dr.
Franklin have seen the splendid results of that management
which he thought indicated the absence of a
particular providence&mdash;could he have beheld the vast
Republic, the abode of liberty, commerce, literature,
and religion, which in less than a century has grown
out of the insurgent colonies&mdash;he would surely have
exclaimed, in the language of the prophet, "Verily
there is a God in the earth!"</p>

<p>In July, Whitefield was called by Lady Huntingdon
to visit Tunbridge Wells, a popular watering
place in Kent, some twenty or thirty miles from London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
to dedicate a new and beautiful house to the
service of God. The congregation was far too large
to be accommodated within the walls; he therefore
preached out of doors from a mount in the court before
the house. His text was, "This is none other
but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
Gen. 28:17. This sermon is said to have been one
of his most eloquent and thrilling efforts; the lofty
energy of his tones, the utter forgetfulness of himself
in the all-absorbing interest of his subject, the very
impersonation of the truths which he uttered as he
stretched forth his hand, "Look yonder; what is
that I see? It is my agonizing Lord! Hark, hark!
do you not hear? O earth, earth, earth, hear the
word of the Lord!" thrilled the vast congregation,
riveting the eye, piercing the conscience, and holding
strong men breathless before the resistless might of
his inspired eloquence. After the service he delivered
an exhortation, and on the next day again preached
and administered the Lord's supper.</p>

<p>He now began to prepare for his <em>seventh</em>, and as it
proved, his <em>last</em> voyage to America, especially to visit
his beloved orphans and friends in Georgia. The
only thing which seems to have grieved him, was the
pain of parting for a time from his London friends.
This was nothing new, but his feelings were even less
reconciled to the event than formerly. "Oh," he
says, "these partings! without a divine support they
would be intolerable. Talk not of taking <em>personal</em>
leave; you know my <em>make</em>. Paul could stand a whipping,
but not a weeping farewell."</p>

<p>The text of his last sermon was John 10:27, 28:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and
they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand." The sermon was printed, and
that very incorrectly; but a few sentences will show
that it was strikingly characteristic: "These words,
it will be recollected, were uttered by Christ at the
feast of dedication. This festival was of bare human
invention, and yet I do not find that our Lord preached
against it. And I believe that when we see things as
we ought, we shall not entertain our auditories about
rites and ceremonies, but about the grand thing. It
is the glory of Methodists, that while they have been
preaching forty years, there has not been, that I know
of, one single pamphlet published by them about the
non-essentials of religion.... The Lord divides the
world into sheep and goats. O sinners, you are come
to hear a poor creature take his last farewell; but I
want you to forget the creature and his preaching. I
want to lead you further than the Tabernacle&mdash;even
to mount Calvary, to see with what expense of blood
Jesus Christ purchased 'his own.' Now, before I go
any further, will you be so good, before the world
gets into your hearts, to inquire whether you belong
to Christ or not. Surely the world did not get into
your hearts before you rose from your beds. Many
of you were up sooner than usual. [The sermon was
preached at seven o'clock in the morning.] I hope
the world does not get into your hearts before nine.
Man, woman, sinner, put thy hand upon thy heart,
and say, Didst thou ever hear Christ's voice so as to
follow him?... I once heard Dr. Marryatt, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
not ashamed of 'market language,' say at Pinner's
Hall, 'God has a great dog to fetch his sheep back
when they wander.' He sends the devil after them,
to bark at them; but instead of barking them further
off, he barks them back to the fold.... 'None shall
pluck them out of my hand.' This implies that there
is always somebody plucking at Christ's sheep. The
lust of the flesh is plucking; the pride of life is plucking;
and the devil is continually plucking at them;
'but nothing shall pluck them out of my hand;' I
have bought them, and am gone to heaven to 'prepare
a place for them.'"</p>

<p>Of this sermon, as taken in shorthand and printed,
Whitefield received a copy while at Deal, and was
much dissatisfied with it. He says, "This morning I
received a surreptitious copy of my Tabernacle farewell
sermon, taken, as the shorthand writer professes,
verbatim as I spoke it. But surely he is mistaken.
The whole is so injudiciously paragraphed, and so
wretchedly unconnected, that I owe no thanks to the
misguided, though it may be well-meant zeal of the
writer and publisher, be they who they will." Had
Whitefield known that the lad of seventeen who had
thus taken down his sermon, would hereafter become
a devoted and useful minister of Christ, the secretary
of the London Missionary Society, the originator of the
London Religious Tract Society, and for many years
the editor of the London Evangelical Magazine, and the
author of "Village Sermons," which have circulated
by hundreds of thousands of volumes in both hemispheres,
how would his heart have warmed towards
him. Let us copy from the journal of George Burder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
as given in his life by his son, the Rev. Dr. H. F.
Burder, a short passage:</p>

<p>"August, 1769. About this time I heard Mr.
Whitefield preach several sermons, particularly his
two last in London; that at Tottenham Court chapel
on Sabbath morning, and that at the Tabernacle on
Wednesday morning at seven o'clock. I remember a
thought which passed my mind, I think, as I was going
to hear his last sermon&mdash;'Which would I rather be,
Garrick or Whitefield?' I thought each, in point of
oratory, admirable in his way. I doubt not conscience
told me which was best. I wrote Mr. Whitefield's
sermons in shorthand, though standing in a
crowd. The latter I copied out, and by the request
of a friend it was printed in about a week. I remember
sitting up part of a night to write it out, and at
the same time I observed the comet which then appeared.
The sermon was very incorrect, and Mr.
Whitefield being detained at Deal before he left England,
saw it, and complained of it."</p>

<p>Before we entirely separate from the Tabernacle,
we wish to record some other interesting facts associated
with it, especially relating to Thomas Wilson,
Esq., for many years the treasurer of Hoxton, afterwards
Highbury, college, who gave the ground on
which the latter building stands, devoted his fortune
to the extension of the cause of Christ, and in addition
to many other noble acts, erected five large
houses of worship in the British metropolis, capable
of seating eight thousand persons. The father of
this gentleman was for many years a devoted deacon
of a Congregational church, but entered into full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
sympathy with the labors of Whitefield, attending
the Tabernacle on Lord's-day evenings. "To this
circumstance, perhaps, may be traced much of his own
zeal for the glory of God, and no inconsiderable portion
of that public spirit which afterwards distinguished
his son Thomas, who well remembered being
carried in his nurse's arms, in company with his parents,
to the scene of Whitefield's ministry, and listening
with such interest as one so young was likely
to feel, to a preacher of surpassing eloquence and
power." The Rev. Dr. Morison, one of his biographers,
adds: "Thus did he imbibe in early life a
strong prepossession for animated public address,
which he never lost in after-years, and which he never
failed to urge upon all youthful candidates for the
sacred office. As might have been expected, the Tabernacle
became his Sabbath home, where he was wont
to listen to men of fervent eloquence, and of purely
evangelical sentiment. He entered, while very young,
into communion with the church in that place, and
afforded a pleasing example of early and consistent
dedication to the service of Christ."</p>

<p>Having finished the service of the Tabernacle
which we just now described, Whitefield went immediately
to Gravesend, twenty miles from London, to
set sail, embarking in the Friendship, Captain Ball,
for Charleston. His companions on the voyage were
Messrs. Winter and Smith, both of them young ministers
of lively zeal; and the former especially, was
distinguished in after-life by great success in his labors
for Christ and his church. Whitefield wrote, "I am
comfortable on every side&mdash;a civil captain and passengers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
all willing to attend on divine worship, and
to hear of religious things."</p>

<p>But delay was the lot of our evangelist and his
friends. They arrived in the Downs, and had to stay
there about a month waiting for a fair wind. While
here, he was delighted with a most unexpected visit
from Dr. Gibbons of London, and the Rev. Mr. Bradbury
of Ramsgate, who had met at Deal to ordain a
young minister. He says, "Wednesday, Sept. 13, I
went on shore, and attended an ordination solemnity
at the dissenting meeting. Several ministers officiated.
Several important questions were asked and
answered before, and a solemn charge given after
imposition of hands. But the prayer put up in the
very act of laying on of hands, by Dr. Gibbons, was
so affecting, and the looks and behavior of those that
joined so serious and solemn, that I hardly know when
I was more struck under any one's ministration. The
ordination being over, at the desire of the ministers
and other gentlemen, I went and dined with them:
our conversation was edifying; and being informed
that many were desirous to hear me preach, I willingly
complied; and I trust some seed was sown
the same evening at Deal, which, by God's heavenly
blessing, will spring up to life eternal. The people of
Deal seemed very civil, and some came to me who
had not forgotten my preaching to them, and their
deceased friends and parents, thirty-two years ago."</p>

<p>Whitefield tells a somewhat amusing anecdote of
Dr. Gibbons, on one of his visits on board. The worthy
doctor was unused to the sea, and became sea-sick,
so that he was obliged to lie down for some time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the state-cabin. "There," says our evangelist, "he
learned more experimentally to pray for those who
do business in the great waters." While yet in the
Downs, Whitefield preached not only on board, but at
Ramsgate and elsewhere. On September 25, in company
with many other ships, they sailed, but soon
were again compelled to cast anchor over against
New Romney and Dungenness. At length, however,
they cleared the channel, and after a long and dangerous
voyage arrived safe at Charleston, S. C. Happily,
Whitefield's health had become greatly renovated,
so that he felt better than after any voyage he
had made for many years. In his memorandum he
wrote:</p>

<p>"November, 1769. For the last week we were
beating about our port, within sight of it, and continued
for two days in Five-fathom hole, just over the
bar. A dangerous situation, as the wind blew hard,
and our ship, like a young Christian, for want of
more ballast, would not obey the helm. But through
infinite mercy, on November 30, a pilot-boat came and
took us safe ashore to Charleston, having been on
board almost thirteen weeks. Friends received me
most cordially. Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget
not all his mercies. Oh, to begin to be a Christian
and minister of Jesus!" On the very day of his
landing, Whitefield preached at Charleston, and learned
from his friend Mr. Wright that all was well at
Bethesda.</p>

<h3>SEVENTH VISIT AND LABORS IN AMERICA&mdash;DEATH.<br />

1769, 1770.</h3>


<p>Whitefield now lost no time in proceeding to his
beloved Bethesda, which at present wore a very inviting
aspect. Writing, January 11, 1770, he says, "Every
thing exceeds my most sanguine expectations. I
am almost tempted to say, 'It is good for me to be
here;' but all must give way to gospel ranging&mdash;divine
employ!</p>

</div></div>

<div class="noindent">In another letter he says, "The increase of this colony
is almost incredible. Two wings are added to the
orphan-house, for the accommodation of students; of
which Governor Wright laid the foundation, March
25, 1769."</div>

<p>An official paper of the Georgia legislature will
show the esteem in which Whitefield was held by that
body.</p>

<p>"Commons House of Assembly, Monday, Jan. 29,
1770. Mr. Speaker reported, that he, with the house,
having waited on the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, in consequence
of his invitation, at the orphan-house academy,
heard him preach a very suitable and pious sermon on
the occasion; and with great pleasure observed the
promising appearance of improvement towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
good purposes intended, and the decency and propriety
of behavior of the several residents there; and
were sensibly affected, when they saw the happy success
which has attended Whitefield's indefatigable
zeal for promoting the welfare of the province in
general, and the orphan-house in particular. Ordered,
that this report be printed in the Gazette.</p>

<p class="sig">
"JOHN SIMPSON, Clerk."
</p>

<p>In pursuance of this vote, we find in the Georgia
Gazette as follows: "Savannah, January 31, 1770.
Last Sunday, his Excellency the Governor, Council,
and Assembly, having been invited by the Rev. Mr.
Whitefield, attended divine service in the chapel of
the orphan-house academy, where prayers were read
by the Rev. Mr. Ellington, and a very suitable sermon
was preached by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, from Zechariah
4:10, 'For who hath despised the day of small
things?' to the great satisfaction of the auditory; in
which he took occasion to mention the many discouragements
he met with, well known to many there, in
carrying on the institution for upwards of thirty years
past, and the present promising prospect of its future
and more extensive usefulness. After divine service,
the company were very politely entertained with a
handsome and plentiful dinner; and were greatly
pleased to see the useful improvements made in the
house, the two additional wings of apartments for
students, one hundred and fifty feet each in length,
and other lesser buildings, in so much forwardness;
and the whole executed with taste, and in so masterly
a manner; and being sensible of the truly generous
and disinterested benefactions derived to the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
through his means, they expressed their gratitude in
the most respectful terms."</p>

<p>On February 10, we find a letter written at Charleston
by Whitefield to his friend Mr. Robert Keen of
London:</p>

<p>"Through infinite mercy, this leaves me enjoying
a greater share of bodily health than I have known
for many years. I am now enabled to preach almost
every day, and my poor feeble labors seem not
to be in vain in the Lord. Blessed be God, all things
are in great forwardness at Bethesda. I have conversed
with the governor in the most explicit manner,
more than once, concerning an act of Assembly for
the establishment of the intended orphan-house college.
He most readily consents. I have shown him
a draft, which he much approves of, and all will be
finished at my return from the northward; in the
meanwhile the building will be carried on. As two
ministers from New Jersey and Rhode Island have
been soliciting benefactions for their respective colleges,
no application of that nature can be made here;
but the Lord will provide.... Since my being in
Charleston, I have shown the draft to some persons of
great eminence and influence. They highly approve
of it, and willingly consent to be some of the wardens.
Nearly twenty are to be of Georgia, and about six of
this place; one of Philadelphia, one of New York,
one of Boston, three of Edinburgh, two of Glasgow,
and six of London. Those of Georgia and South
Carolina are to be qualified; the others to be only
honorary corresponding wardens."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards he again writes to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
friend, "In a few months, I hope all will be completed.
But what may these few months produce? Lord
Jesus, prepare us for whatsoever thou hast prepared
for us, and give peace in our time, for thine infinite
mercy's sake. You must expect another draft soon.
God be praised for that saying, 'It is more blessed to
give than to receive.' You would be pleased to see
with what attention the people hear the word preached.
I have been in Charleston near a fortnight&mdash;am
to preach at a neighboring country parish church
next Sunday, and hope to see Georgia the week following.
Perhaps I may sail from thence to the northward,
and perhaps embark from thence. Lord Jesus,
direct my goings in thy way. I am blessed with
bodily health, and am enabled to go on my way rejoicing.
Grace, grace!"</p>

<p>On returning to Bethesda, his heart seems to have
been full of the orphan-house and the college. For the
direction of the latter, he prepared a series of rules,
and especially provided for the reading of the old
Puritan and Non-conformist writers of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. Every letter he wrote contained
references to the improved state of his health,
and the increased number of preaching engagements
which he was now able to fulfil. His spirits seem to
have been better, and his exultations in the divine
kindness more ardent than ever, while his correspondence
indicates much heavenly-mindedness, and lively
desires for the highest happiness of his friends.</p>

<p>As Whitefield had now been in the south more
than five months, we are not surprised to find that
applications poured in from every part of the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
entreating him to revisit the scenes of other years.
He left Bethesda and its affairs in the hands of persons
worthy of his confidence, of whom he said, "Such
a set of helpers I never met with."</p>

<p>After some hesitation as to where he should first
go, he set out for Philadelphia, where he arrived on
the 6th of May. Writing three days afterwards, he
says, "The evening following, I was enabled to preach
to a large auditory, and have to repeat the delightful
task this evening. Pulpits, hearts, and affections, seem
to be as open and enlarged to me as ever." On the
24th he again wrote, "A wide and effectual door, I
trust, has been opened in this city. People of all
ranks flock as much as ever. Impressions are made
on many, and I trust they will abide. To all the
Episcopal churches, as well as most of the other places
of worship, I have free access. Notwithstanding I
preach twice on the Lord's day, and three or four
times a week besides, yet I am rather better than I
have been for many years. This is the Lord's doing."
On June 14, he says, "This leaves me just returned
from a one hundred and fifty miles' circuit, in which,
blessed be God, I have been enabled to preach every
day. So many new as well as old doors are open,
and so many invitations sent from various quarters,
that I know not which way to turn myself."</p>

<p>Of his last visit to New Jersey, Bishop White of
Philadelphia, then a young man of twenty-three, says,
"When he was on his way from Philadelphia to Boston,
late in the summer, he had been prevailed on to
promise to cross from Bristol to Burlington, and to
preach there. I happened to be in the latter place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and staying in the house of a relative, when it was
announced that Mr. Whitefield was at a tavern on
the other side of the river. He was expected to be
escorted by my relative. I went with him; and we
returned in a boat with Mr. Whitefield and his company.
He preached to the assembled citizens in front
of the court-house, and afterwards dined at the house
of my relative. During dinner, he was almost the
only speaker, as was said to be common; all present
being disposed to listen."</p>

<p>A few days after this visit, we find him at New
York, writing, June 30, "I have been here just a
week. Have been enabled to preach four times; and
am to repeat the delightful task this evening. Congregations
are larger than ever. Blessed be God, I
have been strengthened to itinerate and preach daily
for some time. Next week I purpose to go to Albany;
from thence, perhaps to the Oneida Indians. There
is to be a very large Indian congress; Mr. Kirkland
accompanies me. He is a truly Christian minister
and missionary. Every thing possible should be done
to strengthen his hands and his heart. Perhaps I may
not see Georgia till Christmas. As yet, I keep to my
intended plan, in respect to my returning. Lord
Jesus, direct my goings in thy way. The heat begins
now to be a little intense; but through mercy I am
enabled to bear up bravely. What a God do we
serve!"</p>

<p>On the twenty-ninth of July, he again writes from
the same city, and it is the <em>last entry</em> in his memorandum:
"Since my last, and during this month, I have
been above a five hundred miles' circuit; and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
been enabled to preach and travel through the heat
every day. The congregations have been very large,
attentive, and affected; particularly at Albany, Schenectady,
Great Barrington, Norfolk, Salisbury, Sharon,
Smithfield, Poughkeepsie, Fishkill, New Rumbart,
New Windsor, and Peck's Hill. Last night I returned
hither, and hope to set out for Boston in two or
three days. O what a new scene of usefulness is opening
in various parts of this world! All fresh work
where I have been. The divine influence has been as
at first. Invitations crowd upon me both from ministers
and people, from many, many quarters. A very
peculiar providence led me very lately to a place
where a horse-stealer was executed. Thousands attended.
The poor criminal had sent me several letters,
hearing I was in the country. The sheriff allowed
him to come and hear a sermon under an adjacent
tree. Solemn, solemn! After being by himself about
an hour, I walked half a mile with him to the gallows.
His heart had been softened before my first
visit. He seemed full of solid, divine consolation.
An instructive walk! I went up with him into the
cart. He gave a short exhortation. I then stood
upon the coffin&mdash;added, I trust, a word in season&mdash;prayed&mdash;gave
the blessing, and took my leave. Effectual
good, I hope, was done to the hearers and spectators.
Grace, grace!"</p>

<p>Our local histories seem to delight to honor Whitefield
by the introduction of his name whenever they
have an opportunity. In a notice of Sharon, in "Barber's
Historical Collections of Connecticut," the writer
says, "In the latter part of July, 1770, the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
George Whitefield passed through this town on a
preaching tour. There was considerable opposition
to his being admitted into the meeting-house, and
arrangements had been made to hold the service in
an orchard still standing near the meeting-house, in
case he should be refused. Mr. Smith, [the Rev. Cotton
Mather Smith, a descendant of Cotton Mather,]
invited him into the pulpit, though strongly opposed
by a considerable number of influential men. An immense
congregation from this and the neighboring
towns filled the meeting-house to overflowing. His
text was, 'Marvel not that I said unto you, Ye must
be born again.' He proceeded to discourse on the
doctrine of the new birth with astonishing power and
eloquence, and the congregation were much moved
by the power of the truth and Spirit of God. The
concluding words of his discourse were a quotation,
with a little variation, from the close of the fourth
chapter of Solomon's Song. 'Awake, O north wind,
and come, thou south; blow upon <em>this</em> garden, that
the spices thereof may flow out. Let my Beloved
come into <em>this</em> garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.'
Many of the inhabitants of Sharon followed him for
several successive days, to hear the word of life from
this devoted minister of the cross."</p>

<p>We think it must have been in this journey that
Whitefield's ministry was blessed to the conversion
of a young man who has left his mark on the age.
Benjamin Randall was born in New Castle, New
Hampshire, in 1749. In his twenty-second year he
was brought under the ministry of Whitefield, by
which means he became deeply convinced of sin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
was soon after converted to God. In 1776, he united
with a Calvinistic Baptist church; but before long
began to preach what he accounted more correct doctrines
in his native town, and was honored of God to
effect a very powerful and extensive revival. He is
considered the founder of the denomination of Freewill
Baptists, which now comprises from eleven to
twelve hundred churches, more than a thousand pastors
and licentiates, and upwards of fifty thousand
communicants. Mr. Randall was a man of strong
mental powers, and though he had not a classical education,
he was a good English scholar, aspired after
general and religious knowledge, had fine discriminating
talent, and was remarkable for the perseverance
with which he pursued whatever he undertook.
Above all, like his spiritual father, he possessed what
a living preacher has well called, "a passion for
souls."</p>

<p>From New York Whitefield proceeded to Boston,
and short extracts from two of his letters, and those
<em>the last</em> he wrote, will show his position and his feelings:</p>

<p>September 17, he says to Mr. Wright, at Bethesda,
"Fain would I come by Captain Souder, from Philadelphia;
but people are so importunate for my stay
in these parts, that I fear it will be impracticable.
'My God will supply all my need according to the
riches of his grace in Christ Jesus.' Two or three
evenings ago, I was taken in the night with a violent
flux, attended with retching and shivering, so that I
was obliged to return from Newbury; but through
infinite mercy I am restored, and to-morrow morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
hope to begin again. Never was the word received
with greater eagerness than now. All opposition
seems, as it were, for a while to cease. I find God's
time is the best. The season is critical as to outward
circumstances; but when forts are given up, the Lord
Jesus can appoint salvation for walls and for bulwarks;
he has promised to be a wall of fire round
about his people. This comforts me concerning Bethesda,
though we should have a Spanish war. You
will be pleased to hear, I never was carried through
the summer's heat so well."</p>

<p>And finally, to his dear friend Mr. Keen of London,
he wrote from Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
September 23, just one week before his death, "By
this time I thought to be moving southward. But
never was greater importunity used to detain me
longer in these northern parts. Poor New England
is much to be pitied; Boston people most of all. How
grossly misrepresented! What a mercy that our
Christian charter cannot be dissolved! Blessed be
God for an unchangeable Jesus! You will see, by
the many invitations, what a door is opened for
preaching the everlasting gospel. I was so ill on
Friday that I could not preach, though thousands
were waiting to hear. Well, the day of release will
shortly come, but it does not seem yet; for by riding
sixty miles I am better, and hope to preach here to-morrow.
I trust my blessed Master will accept these
poor efforts to serve him. O for a warm heart! O
to stand fast in the faith, to acquit ourselves like
men, and be strong! May this be the happy experience
of you and yours. I suppose your letters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
gone for me in the Anderson to Georgia. If spared
so long, I expect to see them about Christmas. Still
pray and praise. I am so poorly, and so engaged
when able to preach, that this must apologize for not
writing to more friends: it is quite impracticable."</p>

<p>Whitefield's hope to "preach here to-morrow" was
fully realized. In the "Pennsylvania Journal and
Weekly Advertiser," we find a letter from Portsmouth,
dated Sept. 28, 1770, which says, "Last Sunday
morning came to town from Boston, the Rev.
George Whitefield, and in the afternoon he preached
at the Rev. Dr. Haven's meeting-house; Monday
morning he preached again at the same place, to a
very large and crowded audience. Tuesday morning
a most numerous assembly met at the Rev. Dr. Langdon's
meeting-house, which it is said will hold nearly
six thousand people, and was well filled, even the
aisles. Evening he preached at the Rev. Mr. John
Rodgers' meeting-house in Kittery, and yesterday at
the Rev. Mr. Lyman's in York, to which place a
number of ladies and gentlemen from town accompanied
him. This morning [Friday] he will preach
at the Rev. Dr. Langdon's meeting-house in this
town."</p>

<p>We are now approaching the closing scene, and
are invited to hear Whitefield's last sermon. On his
way to Newburyport, where he had engaged to preach
on Sunday morning, September 30, he was entreated
to preach at Exeter. This had been the scene of
some of his former triumphs. He was once preaching
here, when a man was present who had loaded his
pocket with stones to throw at the preacher. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
heard his prayer with patience, but as soon as he had
read his text, the man took a stone out of his pocket
and held it in his hand, waiting for an opportunity to
throw it. But God sent a word to his heart, and the
stone dropped from his hand. After the sermon, the
poor fellow went to Mr. Whitefield, and said, "Sir,
I came here to-day with the intention of breaking
your head, but God has given me a broken heart."
This man was converted to God, and lived an ornament
to the gospel.</p>

<p>As though it had been felt by the public that this
might be our preacher's last sermon, inconvenient as
Saturday noon must be for the assembling of a congregation
for worship, such a multitude was collected
that no house could contain them, and Whitefield, for
nearly two hours, discoursed to an attentive crowd in
the open air. Of this last sermon at Exeter, a gentleman
who was present has given a deeply interesting
and affecting account. The relator was then in
his eighty-sixth year, but he retained a strong remembrance
of the most trivial incidents connected with
that extraordinary man. He says:</p>

<p>"It was usual for Mr. Whitefield to be attended
by Mr. Smith, who preached when he was unable on
account of sudden attacks of asthma. At the time
referred to, after Mr. Smith had delivered a short
discourse, Mr. Whitefield seemed desirous of speaking;
but from the weak state in which he then was,
it was thought almost impossible. He rose from the
seat in the pulpit, and stood erect, and his appearance
alone was a powerful sermon. The thinness of his
visage, the paleness of his countenance, the evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
struggling of the heavenly spark in a decayed body
for utterance, were all deeply interesting; the spirit
was willing, but the flesh was dying. In this situation
he remained several minutes, unable to speak; he then
said, 'I will wait for the gracious assistance of God,
for he will, I am certain, assist me once more to speak
in his name.' He then delivered perhaps one of his
best sermons, for the light generally burns most splendidly
when about to expire. The subject was a contrast
of the present with the future; a part of this
sermon I read to a popular and learned clergyman in
New York, who could not refrain from weeping when
I repeated the following: 'I go, I go to rest prepared;
my sun has arisen, and by aid from heaven, given
light to many; 't is now about to set for&mdash;no, it cannot
be! 't is to rise to the zenith of immortal glory; I
have outlived many on earth, but they cannot outlive
me in heaven. Many shall live when this body is no
more, but then&mdash;Oh, thought divine!&mdash;I shall be in a
world where time, age, pain, and sorrow are unknown.
My body fails, my spirit expands; how willingly
would I live for ever to preach Christ! but I
die to be with him. How brief, comparatively brief,
has been my life, compared with the vast labors I see
before me yet to be accomplished; but if I leave now,
while so few care about heavenly things, the God of
peace will surely visit you.' These, and many other
things he said, which, though simple, were rendered
important by circumstances; for death had let fly his
arrow, and the shaft was deeply enfixed when utterance
was given to them: his countenance, his tremulous
voice, his debilitated frame, all gave convincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
evidence that the eye which saw him should shortly
see him no more for ever. When I visited the place
where he is entombed, Newburyport, I could not help
saying, 'The memory of the just is blessed,' Few are
there like George Whitefield; however zealous, they
do not possess the masterly power, and those who do,
too often turn it to a purpose that does not glorify
God."</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the Rev. Daniel Rodgers,
a descendant of the martyr of that name, and
pastor of the second congregational church at Exeter.
It was this old friend of Whitefield who had importuned
him to preach at Exeter. The "<cite>Almanack
Journal</cite>" of this excellent man contains the following
items of the activity of our "eloquent orator" in his
closing days: "September 10, 1770, dear Mr. Whitefield
preached here, <small>A. M.</small>, ten o'clock. 11th, Mr.
Whitefield preached again in Mr. Parsons' meeting-house.
12th, I rode over to Rowley, Mr. Whitefield
preached there. 14th, a storm of rain. 15th, the
rain continues. Mr. Whitefield went to Boston, not
well. 25th, I heard dear Mr. Whitefield preach.
26th, he went to Kittery, and preached for brother
John; <small>P. M.</small> I rode to York. 27th, Mr. Whitefield
preached at York; <small>P. M.</small> we returned to Portsmouth.
28th, Mr. Whitefield preached his farewell sermon;
I returned home. 29th, dear Mr. Whitefield preached
for me the last sermon he ever preached."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith's account of the closing scene will not
be considered too minute in its details. "Before he
commenced his journey of fifteen miles from Portsmouth
to Exeter, Mr. Clarkson, senior, observing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
more uneasy than usual, said to him, 'Sir, you are
more fit to go to bed than to preach.' Whitefield's
reply was, 'True, sir;' but turning aside, he clasped
his hands together, and looking up, said, 'Lord Jesus,
I am weary <em>in</em> thy work, but not <em>of</em> thy work. If I
have not yet finished my course, let me go and speak
for thee once more in the fields, seal thy truth, and
come home and die.' His last sermon was from
2 Cor. 13:5, 'Examine yourselves, whether ye be in
the faith. Know ye not your own selves, how that
Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?' He
dined at Captain Gillman's. After dinner, Mr. Whitefield
and Mr. Parsons rode to Newbury. I did not
get there till two hours after them. I found them at
supper. I asked Mr. Whitefield how he felt after his
journey. He said he was tired, therefore he supped
early, and went to bed. He ate a very little supper,
talked but little, asked Mr. Parsons to discharge the
table, and perform family duty, and then retired up
stairs."</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Hallock tells us, that, in 1822, he
visited Newburyport and the tomb of Whitefield. He
was then told by persons whom he considered reliable,
that when Whitefield was retiring to his chamber on
this last evening of his life, many were so desirous to
see and hear him, that he stood on the stairs with a
lamp in his hand, and there gave them a tender spiritual
address.</p>

<p>We resume Mr. Smith's account: "He said he
would sit and read till I came to him, which I did as
soon as possible; and found him reading the Bible,
with Dr. Watts' Psalms lying open before him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
asked me for some water-gruel, and took about half
his usual quantity; and kneeling down by his bedside,
closed the evening with prayer. After a little conversation,
he went to rest, and slept till two in the
morning, when he awoke, and asked for a little cider;
he drank about a wine-glass full. I asked him how
he felt, for he seemed to pant for breath. He said to
me, 'My asthma is coming on again; I must have two
or three days' rest. Two or three days' riding, without
preaching, would set me up again.' Soon afterwards,
he asked me to put the window up a little
higher, though it was half up all night. 'For,' said
he, 'I cannot breathe; but I hope I shall be better by
and by: a good pulpit sweat to-day may give me relief;
I shall be better after preaching.' I said to him,
'I wish you would not preach so often.' He replied,
'I had rather wear out than rust out.' I then told
him, I was afraid he took cold in preaching yesterday.
He said he believed he had; and then sat up in bed,
and prayed that God would be pleased to bless his
preaching where he had been, and also bless his
preaching that day, that more souls might be brought
to Christ. He prayed for direction whether he should
winter in Boston, or hasten to the southward; and he
prayed for a blessing on his Bethesda college, and his
dear family there, for the Tabernacle and Chapel congregations,
and all connections on the other side of
the water; and then he laid himself down to sleep
again.</p>

<p>"This was near three o'clock. At a quarter past
four he awoke, and said, 'My asthma, my asthma is
coming on; I wish I had not given out word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
preach at Haverhill on Monday; I don't think I
shall be able; but I shall see what to-day will bring
forth. If I am no better to-morrow, I will take two
or three days' ride!' He then desired me to warm
him a little gruel; and in breaking the fire-wood, I
waked Mr. Parsons, who thinking I knocked for him,
rose and came in. He went to Mr. Whitefield's bedside,
and asked him how he felt. He answered, 'I
am almost suffocated. I can scarcely breathe, my
asthma quite chokes me.' I was then not a little surprised
to hear how quickly, and with what difficulty
he drew his breath. He got out of bed, and went to
the open window for air. This was exactly at five
o'clock. I went to him, and for about the space of
five minutes saw no danger, only that he had a great
difficulty in breathing, as I had often seen before.
Soon afterwards, he turned himself to me, and said,
'<em>I am dying</em>.' I said, 'I hope not, sir.' He ran to
the other window, panting for breath, but could get
no relief. It was agreed that I should go for Dr.
Sawyer; and on my coming back, I saw death on his
face; and he again said, '<em>I am dying</em>.' His eyes were
fixed, his underlip drawing inward every time he
drew breath. I persuaded him to sit down in the
chair, and have his cloak on; he consented by a sign,
but could not speak. I then offered him a glass of
warm wine; he took half of it, but it seemed as if it
would have stopped his breath entirely. He went
towards the window, and we offered him some warm
wine, with lavender drops, which he refused.</p>

<p>"In a little time he brought up a considerable
quantity of phlegm. I then began to have some small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
hopes. Mr. Parsons said he thought Mr. Whitefield
breathed more freely than he did, and would recover.
I said, 'No, sir, he is certainly dying.' I was continually
employed in taking the phlegm out of his mouth
with a handkerchief, and bathing his temples with
drops, rubbing his wrists, etc., to give him relief, if
possible, but all in vain; his hands and feet were as
cold as clay. When the doctor came in, and saw him
in the chair leaning upon my breast, he felt his pulse,
and said, 'He is a dead man.' Mr. Parsons said, 'I
do not believe it; you must do something, doctor.'
He said, 'I cannot; he is now near his last breath.'
And so indeed it was; for he fetched but one gasp,
and stretched out his feet, and breathed no more.
This was exactly at six o'clock. We continued rubbing
his legs, hands, and feet, with warm cloths, and
bathed him with spirits for some time, but all in vain.
I then put him into a warm bed, the doctor standing
by, and often raised him upright, continued rubbing
him and putting spirits to his nose for an hour, till
all hopes were gone. The people came in crowds to
see him."</p>

<p>Whitefield seems to have had somewhat of a presentiment
that his death would be unattended with
any remarkable expression of spiritual enjoyment.
In his last preceding visit to this country, he had
spent a day or two under the roof of the Rev. Dr.
Finley, then president of the college at Princeton,
New Jersey. One day Dr. Finley said at the dinner-table,
"Mr. Whitefield, I hope it will be very long
before you will be called home; but when that event
shall arrive, I shall be glad to hear the noble testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
you will bear for God." Whitefield replied, "You
would be disappointed, doctor; I shall die silent. It
has pleased God to enable me to bear so many testimonies
for him during my life, that he will require
none from me when I die. No, no. It is your dumb
Christians, who have walked in fear and darkness,
and thereby been unable to bear a testimony for God
during their lives, that he compels to speak out for
him on their death-beds."</p>

<p>We resume Mr. Smith's narrative: "The Rev. Mr.
Parsons, at whose house my dear master died, sent for
Captain Fetcomb, and Mr. Boadman, and others of
his elders and deacons, and they took the whole of
the burial upon themselves, prepared the vault, and
sent and invited the bearers. Many ministers of all
persuasions came to the house of the Rev. Mr. Parsons,
where several of them gave a very particular
account of their first awakenings under his ministry
several years ago, and also of many in their congregations
that, to their knowledge, under God, owed their
conversion to his coming among them, often referring
to the blessed seasons they had enjoyed under his
preaching; and all said, that this last visit was attended
with more power than any other, and that all opposition
fell before him. Then one and another would
pity and pray for his dear Tabernacle and Chapel
congregations, and it was truly affecting to hear them
bemoan America and England's loss. Thus they
continued for two hours, conversing about his great
usefulness, and praying that God would scatter his
gifts, and drop his mantle among them."</p>

<p>Dr. Gillies says, "Early next morning, Mr. Sherburn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of Portsmouth sent Mr. Clarkson and Dr.
Haven with a message to Mr. Parsons, desiring that
Mr. Whitefield's remains might be buried in his own
new tomb, at his own expense; and in the evening
several gentlemen from Boston came to Mr. Parsons,
desiring the body might be carried there. But as
Mr. Whitefield had repeatedly desired to be buried
before Mr. Parsons' pulpit, if he died at Newburyport,
Mr. Parsons thought himself obliged to deny both
these requests."</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons, in a note to his funeral sermon, says,
"At one o'clock all the bells in the town were tolled
for half an hour, and all the vessels in the harbor
gave their proper signals of mourning. At two o'clock
the bells tolled a second time. At three the bells
called to attend the funeral. The Rev. Dr. Haven
of Portsmouth, and the Rev. Messrs. Rodgers of Exeter,
Jewet and Chandler of Rowley, Moses Parsons
of Newbury, and Bass of Newburyport, were
pall-bearers. Mr. Parsons and his family, with many
other respectable persons, followed the corpse in
mourning."</p>

<p>"The procession," says Mr. Smith, "was only one
mile, and then the corpse was carried into the Presbyterian
church, and placed at the foot of the pulpit,
close to the vault; the Rev. Daniel Rodgers made a
very affecting prayer, and openly declared, that, under
God, he owed his conversion to that dear man
of God whose precious remains now lay before them.
Then he cried out, 'O my father, my father!' then
stopped and wept as though his heart would break;
the people weeping all through the place. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
recovered, and finished his prayer, and sat down and
wept. Then one of the deacons gave out the hymn,</p>

<p>
"'Why do we mourn departing friends?'<br />
</p>

<div class="noindent">some of the people weeping, some singing, and so on
alternately. The Rev. Mr. Jewet preached a funeral
discourse; and made an affectionate address to his
brethren, to lay to heart the death of that useful man
of God, begging that he and they might be upon their
watchtower, and endeavor to follow his blessed example.
The corpse was then put into the vault, and all
concluded with a short prayer, and dismission of the
people, who went weeping through the streets to their
respective places of abode."</div>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Rodgers, from whose "Almanack
Journal" we have quoted, records that the vast assembly
at the funeral consisted of "four, since thought
five thousand people," and adds, Oct. 7, "I preached
from those words in the first Philippians, 'Having a
desire to depart and be with Christ,' etc. I spoke
extempore, somewhat largely, of dear Mr. Whitefield's
character."</p>

<p>The late venerable Mr. Bartlet of Newburyport,
some years ago, erected a monument to the memory
of Whitefield in the church beneath which his remains
are interred. The cenotaph was executed by Mr.
Struthers of Philadelphia, after a design of Strickland,
and the inscription which follows was written
by the late Rev. Dr. Ebenezer Porter, of the Theological
seminary at Andover.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>TESTIMONIES AND FACTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHITEFIELD'S
CHARACTER.</h3>


<p>"Last evening," says a letter from Boston, October
1, 1770, to the "Pennsylvania Journal," "we were
informed by a melancholy messenger from Newburyport,
that yesterday morning about six o'clock, at that
place, the renowned and Rev. George Whitefield,
chaplain to the Right Hon. the Countess of Huntingdon,
etc., was, by a sudden mandate, summoned to the
bosom of his Saviour. He had been preaching in
divers parts of this province since his arrival from
the southward, with his usual diligence and energy;
was now from a tour to the province of New Hampshire
on his return to this town, but being seized with
a violent fit of the asthma, was in a short space translated
from the labors of this life to the enjoyment of
a better.</p>

<p>"Of this truly pious and very extraordinary personage,
little can be said but what every friend to
vital Christianity who has sat under his ministry will
readily attest. In his public performances throughout
Europe and British America, he has, for a long
course of years, astonished the world as a prodigy of
eloquence and devotion. With what frequency and
cheerfulness did he ascend the desk, the language of
his actions being ever, 'Wist ye not that I must be
about my Master's business?' With what divine pathos
did he plead with, and persuade by the most engaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
incitements, the impenitent sinner to the practice
of piety and virtue. Filled with the spirit of grace,
he spoke from the heart; and with a fervency of zeal
perhaps unequalled since the apostles, ornamented
the celestial annunciations of the preacher with the
graceful and most enticing charms of rhetoric and
oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the
command of an ever-crowded and admiring auditory;
nor was he less entertaining and instructive in his
private conversation and deportment. Happy in a
remarkable ease of address, willing to communicate,
studious to edify, and formed to amuse&mdash;such, in
more retired life, was he whom we lament. And while
a peculiar pleasantry enlivened and rendered his company
agreeable, his conversation was ever marked
with the greatest objects of his pursuit&mdash;virtue and
religion. It were to be wished that the good impressions
of his ministry may be long retained; and that
the rising generation, like their pious ancestors, may
catch a spark of that ethereal flame which burnt with
such lustre in the sentiments and practice of this
faithful servant of the most high God."</p>

<p>Another contemporaneous article says, "Dr. Cooper
of Brattle-street, called an enthusiast by none, won
early to serious religion by his [Whitefield's] instrumentality,
delivered a sermon upon his death, in which
he pronounced a strong eulogy in favor of his holy
and successful activity in the cause of vital and practical
religion through the English dominions. Pews,
aisles, and seats were so crowded, and heads and
shoulders were in such close phalanx, that it looked
as though a man might walk everywhere upon the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
surface of the assembly, without finding an opening
for descending to the floor."</p>

<p>When the news of Mr. Whitefield's death reached
Georgia, its inhabitants vied with each other in showing
him the highest respect. All the black cloth in
the stores was bought up; the pulpit and desk of the
church, the branches, the organ-loft, and the pews of
the governor and council were covered with black.
The governor and council in deep mourning convened
at the state-house, and went in procession to church,
where they were received by the organ playing a funeral
dirge. Two funeral sermons were there listened
to by the authorities. In the Legislature high eulogiums
were pronounced on the admirable preacher,
and a sum of money was unanimously appropriated
for removing his remains to Georgia, to be interred
at his orphan-house; but the inhabitants of Newburyport
strongly objected, and the design was relinquished.
Forty-five years later when a new county was
formed in Georgia, it received the name of Whitefield
in commemoration of his worth and useful services.</p>

<p>In a letter from Dr. Franklin to a gentleman in
Georgia, he says, "I cannot forbear expressing the
pleasure it gives me to see an account of the respect
paid to his memory by your assembly. I knew him
intimately upwards of thirty years; his integrity, disinterestedness,
and indefatigable zeal in prosecuting
every good work, I have never seen equalled, I shall
never see excelled."</p>

<p>Of course it would be expected that the sermons
at Savannah would be of great interest. Such a discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
was delivered by the Rev. Mr. Ellington, who
very truly said, "Whitefield's longing desires for the
salvation of immortal souls would not admit of his
being confined within the limits of any walls. How
he has preached, with showers of stones, and many
other instruments of malice and revenge about his
ears, many of his surviving friends can witness. But
having the salvation of sinners at heart, and a great
desire to rescue them from the power of an eternal
death, he resolved to spend and be spent for the service
of precious and immortal souls; and spared no
pains and refused no labor, so that he might administer
to their real and eternal good. He died like a
hero on the field of battle. Thousands in England,
Scotland, and America have great reason to bless
God for his ministrations."</p>

<p>Who shall attempt to describe the feelings of the
congregations at the Tabernacle and Tottenham Court
chapels, when the news of their pastor's death first
reached them? All were indeed clothed in mourning.
By Whitefield's own previous appointment, the
Rev. John Wesley preached the funeral sermon at
Tottenham Court-road chapel. The preacher bore
this testimony: "In his public labors he has for many
years astonished the world with his eloquence and
devotion. With what divine pathos did he persuade
the impenitent sinner to embrace the practice of early
piety and virtue. Filled with the spirit of grace, he
spoke from the heart with a fervency of zeal perhaps
unequalled since the days of the apostles; and adorned
the truths he delivered with the most graceful
charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
was unrivalled in the command of an ever-crowded
auditory. It was the love of God shed abroad in his
heart by the Holy Ghost which filled his soul with
tender, disinterested love to every child of man....
Mention has been already made of his unparalleled
zeal, his indefatigable activity, his tender-heartedness
to the afflicted, and charitableness towards the poor.
But should we not likewise mention his deep gratitude
to all whom God had used as instruments of
good to him? of whom he did not cease to speak in
the most respectful manner, even to his dying day.
Should we not mention that he had a heart susceptible
of the most generous and the most tender friendship?
I have frequently thought that this, of all others,
was the distinguishing part of his character. How
few have we known of so kind a temper, of such large
and flowing affections! Was it not principally by
this that the hearts of others were so strongly drawn
and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love?
This shone in his very countenance, and continually
breathed in all his words, whether in public or private.
Was it not this which, quick and penetrating
as lightning, flew from heart to heart; which gave
that life to his sermons, his conversation, his letters?
Ye are witnesses."</p>

<p>The Rev. John Newton preached a funeral sermon
at Olney, where he was then settled, from the highly
appropriate text, "He was a burning and a shining
light," John 5:35, in which he thus speaks of Whitefield:
"Some ministers are burning and shining lights
in a peculiar and eminent degree. Such a one, I doubt
not, was the servant of God whose death we now lament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
I have had some opportunities of looking over
the history of the church in past ages; I am not backward
to say, that I have not read or heard of any
person, since the apostles' days, of whom it may be
more emphatically said, 'He was a burning and a shining
light,' than the late Mr. Whitefield; whether we
consider the warmth of his zeal, the greatness of his
ministerial talents, or the extensive usefulness with
which the Lord honored him. I do not mean to praise
the man, but the Lord who furnished him, and made
him what he was. He was raised up to shine in a
dark place. The state of religion when he first appeared
in public, was very low in our established
church. I speak the truth, though to some it may be
an offensive truth. The doctrines of grace were seldom
heard from the pulpit, and the life and power of
godliness were little known. Many of the most spiritual
among the dissenters, were mourning under a
sense of a great spreading declension on their side.
What a change has taken place throughout the land
within a little more than thirty years; that is, since
the time when the first set of despised ministers came
to Oxford! And how much of this change has been
owing to God's blessing on Mr. Whitefield's labors,
is well known to many who have lived through this
period, and can hardly be denied by those who are
least willing to allow it.... His zeal was not like
wildfire, but directed by sound principles, and a sound
judgment.... The Lord gave him a manner of
preaching which was peculiarly his own. He copied
from none, and I never met with any one who could
imitate him with success."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>With regret we tear ourselves away from Romaine
and Toplady, from Pemberton and Parsons, and from
a multitude of others who bore testimonies like those
we have given, but which would exceed the limits of
our narrative.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton, after his removal to London, once
breakfasting with a company of noblemen and gentlemen,
was asked if he knew Mr. Whitefield. He
answered in the affirmative, and remarked, that as a
preacher Mr. Whitefield far exceeded every other
man of his time. Mr. Newton added, "I bless God
that I lived in his time: many were the winter mornings
I rose at four o'clock to attend his Tabernacle
discourses at five; and I have seen Moorfields as full
of lanterns at these times, as I suppose the Hay market
is full of flambeaux on an opera night." As a proof
of the power of Mr. Whitefield's preaching, Mr. Newton
said, that a military officer at Glasgow, who had
heard him preach, laid a wager with another, that at
a certain charity sermon, though he went with prejudice,
he would be compelled to give something. The
other, to make sure that he would not, laid aside all
the money out of his pockets; but before he left the
church, he was glad to borrow some, and lose his bet.
Mr. Newton mentioned as another striking illustration
of Mr. Whitefield's persuasive oratory, his collecting
after one sermon &#163;600, or about $3,000, for the inhabitants
of an obscure village in Germany, that had been
burned down. After this sermon, Whitefield said,
"We shall sing a hymn, during which those who do
not choose to give their mite on this awful occasion,
may sneak off." Not one moved; he came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
from the pulpit, ordered all the doors to be shut but
one, at which he held the plate himself, and collected
the large sum we have named. Mr. Newton farther
stated what he knew to be a fact, that at the time
of Whitefield's greatest persecution, when obliged
to speak in the streets, in one week he received
not fewer than a thousand letters from persons distressed
in their consciences by the energy of his
preaching.</p>

<p>A gentleman of title in England was one day examining
some works of the distinguished sculptor,
John Bacon. Among them he observed a bust of Mr.
Whitefield, which led him to remark, "After all that
has been said, this was truly a great man; he was
the founder of a new religion." Mr. Bacon replied,
"A new religion, sir?" "Yes," said the baronet;
"what do you call it?" "Nothing," was the reply,
"but the old religion revived with new energy,
and treated as though the preacher meant what he
said."</p>

<p>Several interesting narratives have been given of
visits to the tomb of Whitefield, which show the preciousness
of his memory.</p>

<p>In 1834, the Rev. Andrew Reed, D. D., of London,
and the late Rev. James Matheson, D. D., of
Durham, visited this country as a deputation to its
churches from the Congregational Union of England
and Wales. In describing their visit to Newburyport,
Dr. Reed says, "We had a conference with the
pastors here, and afterwards went to the church
which is enriched with the remains of Whitefield.
The elders of the church were present in the porch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
to receive us. We descended to the vault. There
were three coffins before us. Two pastors of the
church lay on either side, and the remains of Whitefield
in the centre. The cover was slipt aside, and
they lay beneath my eye. I had before stood in his
pulpits; seen his books, his rings, and chairs; but
never before had I looked on part of his very self.
The skull, which is perfect, clean, and fair, I received,
as is the custom, into my hand. I could say nothing;
but thought and feeling were busy. On returning to
the church, I proposed an exercise of worship. We
collected over the grave of the eloquent, the devoted,
and seraphic man, and gave expression to the sentiments
that possessed us, by solemn psalmody and fervent
prayer. It was not an ordinary service to any
of us."</p>

<p>In the year 1835, a similar deputation visited this
country from the Baptist Union of Great Britain and
Ireland. It consisted of the late Rev. F. A. Cox,
D. D., of London, and the Rev. James Hoby, D. D.,
then of Birmingham. They also visited the tomb of
our never-to-be-forgotten evangelist. We give a few
sentences from their report: "We made an excursion
to Newburyport, thirty-nine miles from Boston, to see
the tomb of Whitefield. On our arrival, we hastened
to the depository of the precious remains of that eminent
servant of God.... We descended with some
difficulty into the subterraneous vault, which is immediately
behind the pulpit, in a small chamber like a
vestry, external to the body of the church. Deep expectant
emotions thrilled through our bosoms, while
a kind of trap-door was opened, and we descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
beneath the floor to another door, which stood perpendicularly,
by which we entered, or rather crept,
into the awful and silent sepulchre. There were three
coffins placed in parallel lines; two of them containing
the mortal part of Mr. Parsons and Mr. Prince,
pastors of the church. We instinctively took our
seats, the one on the one coffin, the other on the other,
with the coffin of Whitefield between, over which,
when the upper part of the lid was removed, to reveal
the skeleton secrets of the narrow prison-house, we
bent in solemn stillness and awe. We gazed on
the fragments&mdash;we contemplated and handled the
skull of that great preacher of righteousness&mdash;we
thought of his devoted life, his blessed death, his high
and happy destiny; and whispered our adorations
of the grace that formed him both for earth and
heaven."</p>

<p>The following lines were written by the departed
and amiable William B. Tappan, on visiting this spot
in September, 1837.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And this was Whitefield!&mdash;this, the dust now blending<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With kindred dust, that wrapt his soul of fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which, from the mantle freed, is still ascending<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through regions of far glory, holier, higher.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Oh, as I gaze here with a solemn joy<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And awful reverence, in which shares Decay,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Yields it not yet to doom which all obey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How follows thought his flight, at Love's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From hemisphere in sin, to hemisphere,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>
<p>In December, 1845, one of the London daily papers,
"The Sun," contained a somewhat extended account
of Whitefield in New England, and especially his
death, funeral, and tomb, from which we borrow mementos
that in both hemispheres may be interesting
"for generations to come."</p>

<p>"I was spending Sunday at Old Ipswich, in the
latter part of last September, when by accident I fell
in with an old inhabitant of the town who had heard
Whitefield preach there. He was a sort of patriarch
of the place, and as he sat on one of the stones which
surrounded the ancient orthodox meeting-house, his
grey locks streaming from beneath his queerly shaped
hat, and attired in his primly cut old-fashioned coat,
he appeared no bad representative of the departed
Puritans who, in former days, had soberly and decently
obeyed the call of the Sabbath bell, and worshipped in
the same temple whose steeple now casts its shadow
athwart the green sward beneath.... As the bell of
Old Ipswich church swung out that bright Sabbath
morning, it was a pretty sight to see the village people
coming from different points to the decaying old
church, which was situated, as most country churches
in New England are, on a hill-top. While I was enjoying
the scene, the old man to whom I have alluded,
and who was sitting on a stone, accosted me, and
asked me if I was not a stranger 'in these parts.' On
my informing him that I was, he pointed out to me the
'lions' of the neighborhood, and wound up by asking,
'I suppose, sir, you've heard of Whitefield?'</p>

<p>"'Of Whitefield? to be sure I have.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I've seen Whitefield, George Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
stood on this very stone,' (dropping his stick
feebly from his shaking hands,) 'and I heard him
preach here.'</p>

<p>"'And do you remember any thing about him?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"'Well, I guess I do. I was but a bit of a boy
then; but here he stood on this stone, looking like a
flying angel, and we call this Whitefield's pulpit to
this day.... There was folks here from all parts
to hear him; so he was obliged to preach outside, for
the church wasn't half big enough for 'em, and no
two ways about it. I've heard many parsons sin'
that time, but none on 'em could come nigh him, any
how they could fix it.'</p>

<p>"'Do you remember any thing of his sermons?'
I inquired.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I was too young to notice aught, sir, but the
preacher hisself and the crowds of people, but I know
he had a very sweet voice; and as I said, when he
spread his arms out, with a little Bible in his hand,
he looked like a flying angel. There never were so
many people, afore nor since, in Old Ipswich. I suppose,
sir, you'll be going to see his bones? He was
buried at Newburyport, and you can see 'em if you
like.'</p>

<p>"I made up my mind that I would see them, if
possible. On the following day, I went over to Newburyport
by railroad, and proceeded first to the house
in which Whitefield died. It was at the time the
residence of the Rev. Jonathan Parsons, the first regular
pastor of the Presbyterian Society in the town.
It is a plain unpretending structure, possessing no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
other claims to attention than its being the spot where
the last scene of Whitefield's career was enacted. I
knocked, and asked of a lady who answered my summons,
if I might be allowed to see the room in which
Mr. Whitefield died. She very courteously showed
me up a flight of stairs into a chamber, which, she
said, Mr. Whitefield used to sleep in. 'Here is the
place he died in,' said the lady, as she showed me a
little entry just outside the door of the chamber, directly
over the entrance to the house. 'He lay the
night before he died,' said the lady, 'in that bed-chamber;
and when he was struck with death, he ran out
to this entry window for breath, and died while sitting
in a chair opposite to it.'</p>

<p>"The Federal-street church, where Whitefield was
buried, was but a short distance from the house in
which he died, and on my way to it I called on the
sexton.... He preceded me through the aisle of the
church, and opening a little narrow door by the side
of the pulpit, we passed into a dim gloomy room
behind it, and from thence descending four or five
steps, found ourselves in a brick vault which lay directly
under the pulpit. It was two or three minutes
before my eyes got accustomed to the gloom; but
soon objects became discernible, and I saw three old
coffins, two of them serving as supporters to the third,
which lay across them.... The sexton trimmed his
lamp, then lifted the lid of an old coffin, and holding
the flame close to it, said, 'Here, look in, ... <small>THAT'S
THE MAN</small>.'</p>

<p>"Yes, there lay the man, or at least, all that remains
of the once mighty preacher. A strange awe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
came over me at his words, '<em>That's the man.</em>' I took
the skull in my hands, and examined it carefully. The
forehead was rather narrow than broad, and by no
means high. I soon put it back again to the coffin."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the more prominent traits in the character
of Whitefield, we may designate his <em>indifference to his
own honor and ease</em>, of which his narrative contains
almost innumerable illustrations. In the preparation
of the deed of trust for his intended college, he entirely
omitted his own name, that the proposed trustees
might accept the office without suffering contempt
for being connected with him. It was not pretence
which led him often to say, "Let the name of George
Whitefield perish, if God be glorified." On the same
principle of almost self-annihilation he acted in reference
to the accumulation of money. He secured nothing
for himself. It does not seem that what he left
to his friends by his will was or could be paid; what
had been left him as legacies had been nearly all
expended, and would have been entirely, had he lived
to return to his beloved Bethesda. By his will he
placed the institution in the hands of Lady Huntingdon,
who sent out ministers and other persons to conduct
it. But soon after this, the buildings were burnt
down. After the fire, came the Revolutionary war,
which tended to unsettle the tenure of property, and
at the time of its close, the whole plans, alike of the
orphan-house and the college, were nearly unknown.
The authorities of Savannah, in accordance with the
high regard which they still entertained for Whitefield's
memory, secured whatever they could of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
wreck, the proceeds of which they invested in a school
for the young, which yet flourishes.</p>

<p>Perhaps no man was ever more thoroughly <em>fond of
labor</em>. From a memorandum in which Mr. Whitefield
recorded the times and places of his ministerial labors,
it appears that from the period of his ordination to
that of his death, which was thirty-four years, he
preached upwards of <em>eighteen thousand sermons</em>. It
would be difficult to imagine how many thousand
miles he travelled. When he ascertained that his
physical powers began to fail, putting himself on what
he called "short allowance," he preached <em>only once on
every week-day, and three times on the Sabbath</em>. In view
of his various journeyings in the slow and inconvenient
modes of travelling then in use, his thirteen voyages
across the Atlantic, and all that he accomplished,
it appears that few men ever performed so much labor
within the same period.</p>

<p>Nearly every one who has attempted a description
of Whitefield has said much of his <em>extraordinary voice</em>.
It is known that Garrick was heard to say that he
would give a hundred guineas if he could say "Oh!"
as Whitefield did. The late Rev. Dr. Haweis, speaking
of his "wonderful voice," and of its sweetness and
variety of tone, said he believed on a serene evening
it might be distinctly heard for nearly a mile. Others
have given similar evidence.</p>

<p>The late Sir George Beaumont, no mean authority
on such a subject, thus familiarly speaks: "Oh yes; I
heard that young gentleman this morning allude to
'roaring Whitefield,' and was amused at his mistake.
It is a common one. Whitefield did not roar. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
have been his auditor more than once, and was delighted
with him. Whitefield's voice could be heard
at an immense distance; but that was owing to its
fulness, roundness, and clearness. It was a perfectly
sound voice. It is an odd description, but I can hit
upon no better; there was neither crack nor flaw.
To describe him as a bellowing, roaring field preacher,
is to describe a mountebank, not Whitefield. He
had powers of pathos of the highest order. The tender,
soft, persuasive tones of his voice were melodious
in the extreme. And when he desired to win, or persuade,
or plead, or soothe, the gush of feeling which
his voice conveyed at once surprised and overpowered
you."</p>

<p>Speaking on the authority of his tutor, the Rev.
Cornelius Winter, the late excellent Mr. Jay says that
Whitefield's voice was incomparable: not only distinct
and loud, but abounding with every kind of inflection,
and perfectly under his power; so that he could render
every thing he expressed, however common or insignificant
in itself, striking and affecting.</p>

<p>This distinguished man had a peculiar talent for
making the <em>narration of facts tell in the pulpit</em>. Nothing
occurred among even his own family connections, but
he would make it contribute to the edification of his
auditors. One Lord's day morning, with his usual
fervor he exhorted his hearers to give up the use of
means for the spiritual good of their relatives and
friends only with their lives. He told them he had a
brother, for whose spiritual welfare he had very long
used every possible means. He had warned him, and
prayed for him, but all apparently to no purpose, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
a few weeks previous; when that brother, to his astonishment
and joy, came to his house, and with many
tears declared that he had come up from the country
to testify to him the great change which divine grace
had wrought in his heart, and to acknowledge with
gratitude his obligation to the man by whom God had
wrought. Mr. Whitefield added, that he had that
morning received information, that on his brother's
return to Gloucestershire, where he resided, he dropped
down dead as he was getting out of a stagecoach.
"Let us pray always," said he, "for ourselves,
and for those who are dear to us, and never
faint."</p>

<p>This habit of making every occurrence bear on his
ministry, Mr. Winter, who knew him more intimately,
and has told us more of his private life and conduct
than any other man, tells us was "perfectly in character
with Mr. Whitefield. He turned every thing into
gold; he improved every thing for good. Passing
occurrences determined the matter of his sermons,
and, in some degree, the manner of his address. Thus,
if he had read on astronomy in the course of the week,
you would be sure to discover it. He knew how to
convert the centripetal motion of the planets to the
disposition of the Christian towards Christ; and the
fatal attraction of the world was very properly represented
by a reference to the centrifugal. If he attended
any extraordinary trial, he would avail himself of
the formality of the judge in pronouncing sentence.
It would only be by hearing him, and by beholding
his attitude and tears, that a person could well conceive
the effect; for it was impossible but that solemnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
must surround him who, under God, became the
means of making all solemn."</p>

<p>He sometimes made use of an incident of history
in the reign of Henry VIII. The apprentices of London
appeared before that monarch, pleading his pardon
for their insurrections, manifesting intense feeling
on the matter, and praying for "mercy, mercy." "Take
them away, take them away," was the monarch's request,
moved by the sight and the cries of these youths,
"I cannot bear it." The application, as will be readily
supposed, was, that if an earthly monarch of Henry's
character could be so moved, how prevalent must
be the plea of the sinner in the ears of infinite Love.</p>

<p>The case of two Scotchmen in the convulsion of the
state at the time of Charles II. served him on more
than one occasion. These men, having to pass some
of the troops, were thinking of their danger, and meditating
the best way of escape, when one of them proposed
wearing a skullcap; but the other, thinking
that would imply distrust of the providence of God,
determined to proceed bareheaded. The last was
the first laid hold of, and being asked, "Are you for
the covenant?" replied, "Yes;" and being further
asked, "What covenant?" answered, "The covenant
of grace;" by which reply, eluding farther inquiry, he
was allowed to pass; but the other, not answering
satisfactorily, received a blow from the sabre, which
penetrating through the cap, struck him dead. In the
application, Mr. Whitefield, warning against vain
confidence, exclaimed, "Beware of your skullcaps."</p>

<p>An American clergyman has told us that he once
related to Whitefield an affecting occurrence, but did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
it with the ordinary brevity and feeling of common
conversation. Afterwards he heard Mr. Whitefield
preach, and tell this same story with such nature,
pathos, and power, that the clergyman found himself
weeping like a child. It has been well said, that he
spoke with the tones of the soul; and that his gestures
were impelled by the same spontaneous magical influence
which made them, as well as his words, seem part
of his soul. Indeed, he threw his soul into every
thing he did and said.</p>

<p>It is said that Whitefield would sometimes rise in
the sacred desk, and for a minute or two looking in
silence around his vast audience, as if salvation or
perdition teemed in every cast of his eye, would burst
into tears, while the swift contagion, before he uttered
a word, had reached every heart that could feel, and
dimmed every eye that could weep.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>While his path to the sinner's heart was thus met
with tears, he was never without strength or aim.
He struck everywhere. He swung his glittering
weapon, "the sword of the Spirit," in every direction,
the same whether he preached in the cushioned and
carpeted pulpit to lords, ladies, and gentlemen, or encountered
a mob of stage-players and merry-andrews
in the open field. He insisted on instant, visible,
decisive action in his hearers. All was commotion
where he moved. The very earth would seem to be
shaken with the thunder of his eloquence; the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
seemed, in the bold metaphor of Isaiah, to "drop
down from above, and the skies to pour down righteousness,"
when he set the trumpet of the gospel to
his lips, and made the notes of salvation or perdition
ring in the ears of dying men. Such unwonted sounds
startled the multitude into life, rousing energies that
were forthwith enlisted either for or against the
mighty cause which he advocated, with the boldness
and fervor of one who had received immediate commission
from heaven. His sacred ambition was content
with nothing short of the conquest of thousands.</p>

<p>It has been well said by a living American writer,
that "Whitefield was, in sacred eloquence, what Handel
was in sacred music. There was an air, a soul,
and a <em>movement</em> in his oratory, which created indescribable
emotion in his vast assemblies, and if Handel,
with a thousand auxiliary voices and instruments,
astonished the multitude in Westminster Abbey, even
to raising them on their feet, by the performance of
his Messiah, Whitefield did greater wonders in his
single person by <em>preaching</em> the Messiah to the immense
crowds in Tottenham Court-road and Moorfields."</p>

<p>The same writer has said elsewhere, "The influence
of Whitefield and Edwards on theology and pulpit
eloquence were immense. There was in those
two men indeed 'a diversity of gifts, but the same
spirit,' The intellect prevailed in Edwards, the impassioned
in Whitefield. Pure truth came forth from
the mind of the one as nakedly demonstrated as it
ever was on the pages of Newton and Locke; for Edwards,
when but a child, read Locke with enthusiasm.
From the soul of Whitefield it came forth arrayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the gorgeous robes of his own many-colored imagination,
baptized in the tenderness of his own sympathetic
spirit. At times, indeed, the thunders of Sinai
seemed to shake the sacred desk, but the softer music
of the harp of Zion was more congenial with his compassionate
spirit, though he was always bold for God,
and braved danger in every form for the salvation of
sinners. It is not strange that American preachers
venerate, even to enthusiasm, the memory of such a
man, and visit his dust, enshrined as it is in the bosom
of New England, with feelings of indescribable interest.
His labors were for us; his rest is with us; his
example is before us. The first were indefatigable;
the second is peaceful; the last is glorious."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Winter says, "I hardly ever knew
him to go through a sermon without weeping more or
less;" and again, "It was only by beholding his attitude
and tears, that one could well conceive of the
effect." No doubt there was a connection between
the tears of Whitefield and his piety; but it must not
be supposed that he was always "the weeping prophet;"
he could smile as well as weep. A venerable
lady in New York, known to some yet living, speaking
of the influence which first won her heart to God,
said that "Mr. Whitefield was so cheerful that it
<em>tempted her to be a Christian</em>."</p>

<p>Every thing about this distinguished man excited
attention. His voice, accompanied by his look from
crossed eyes, and proceeding from a man of his robust
frame, produced wonderful effects. It is said that
when once preaching in a graveyard, two young men
conducted themselves improperly, when he fixed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
eyes upon them, and with a voice resembling thunder,
said, "Come down, ye rebels." They instantly fell,
neither of them being inclined again to come into
contact with such a look, or to hear such a voice.</p>

<p>He was once preaching to a vast crowd of people
in southern Pennsylvania, which was at that time
ignorant and uncivilized. He was incessantly disturbed
by their noise, and twice reproved them with
great severity. At length he was so overcome by
their noisy and irreverent conduct, that he stopped
short, dropped his head into his hands, burst into a
flood of tears, and exclaimed, "Oh, Lord God, I am
ashamed that these people are provoking thy wrath,
and I dare not reprove them a third time." Such was
the effect of his conduct and feeling, that his audience
became perfectly quiet, and remained so till the end
of his discourse.</p>

<p>We have before us two narratives of his preaching
during very heavy storms. Dr. Campbell, a successor
of Whitefield in the <em>Tabernacle</em> in London, and whose
ministry has been marked by much of the power and
success of his great predecessor, has given to the first
of these narratives the title of "<cite>Thunder and Eloquence</cite>."
Before he commenced his sermon on this occasion,
long darkening columns crowded the bright
sunny sky of the morning, and swept their dull shadows
over the building, in fearful augury of the storm.</p>

<p>His text was, "Strive to enter in at the strait
gate; for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter
in, and shall not be able." "See," said he, pointing
to a shadow that was flitting across the floor&mdash;"see
that emblem of human life. It passed for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and concealed the brightness of heaven from our view;
but it is gone. And where will ye be, my hearers,
when your lives have passed away like that dark
cloud? Oh, my dear friends, I see thousands sitting
attentively, with their eyes fixed on the poor unworthy
preacher. In a few days, we shall all meet at
the judgment-seat of Christ. We shall form a part
of that vast assembly that will gather before the
throne; and every eye will behold the Judge. With
a voice whose call you must abide and answer, he
will inquire whether on earth you strove to enter in
at the strait gate; whether you were supremely devoted
to God; whether your hearts were absorbed in
him. My blood runs cold when I think how many of
you will then seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
Oh, what plea can you make before the Judge of the
whole earth? Can you say it has been your whole
endeavor to mortify the flesh, with its affections and
lusts&mdash;that your life has been one long effort to do
the will of God? No; you must answer, 'I made
myself easy in the world by flattering myself that
all would end well; but I have deceived my own
soul, and am lost.'</p>

<p>"You, O false, and hollow Christian, of what avail
will it be that you have done many things&mdash;that you
have read much in the sacred word&mdash;that you have
made long prayers&mdash;that you have attended religious
duties, and that you have appeared holy in the eyes
of men? What will all this be, if, instead of loving
Him supremely, you have been supposing you should
exalt yourself in heaven by acts really polluted and
unholy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you, rich men, wherefore do you hoard your
silver? Wherefore count the price you have received
for Him whom you every day crucify in your love of
gain? Why&mdash;that when you are too poor to buy a
drop of cold water, your beloved son may be rolled
to hell in his chariot, pillowed and cushioned around
him."</p>

<p>The eye of the preacher gradually lighted up as
he proceeded, till towards the close it seemed to sparkle
with celestial fire. With his whole energy he
exclaimed, "O sinners, by all your hopes of happiness,
I beseech you to repent. Let not the wrath of God
be awakened. Let not the fires of eternity be kindled
against you. See there!" pointing to the lightning,
which played on the corner of the pulpit, "it is a
glance from the angry eye of Jehovah!" Raising his
finger in a listening attitude, as the distant thunder
grew louder and louder, and broke in one tremendous
crash over the building, he continued, "Hark! It was
the voice of the Almighty as he passed by in his anger!"
As the sound died away, he covered his face
with his hands, and knelt beside his pulpit, apparently
lost in inward and intense prayer. The storm passed
rapidly away, and the sun, beaming forth in his might,
threw across the heavens a magnificent arch of peace.
Rising, and pointing to the beautiful object, he exclaimed,
"Look upon the rainbow, and praise Him
who made it. Very beautiful it is in the brightness
thereof. It compasseth the heavens about with glory;
and the hands of the Most High have bended it!"</p>

<p>On another occasion, as Mr. Whitefield was
preaching in Boston, on the wonders of creation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
providence, and redemption, a violent storm of thunder
and lightning came on. In the midst of the sermon
it attained to so alarming a height that the congregation
sat in almost breathless awe. The preacher
closed his note-book, and stepping into one of the
wings of the desk, fell on his knees, and with much
feeling and fine taste repeated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hark, <span class="smcap">the Eternal</span> rends the sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A mighty voice before him goes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A voice of music to his friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But threatening thunder to his foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Come, children, to your Father's arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hide in the chambers of my grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till the fierce storm be overblown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my revenging fury cease&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="noindent">"Let us devoutly sing to the praise and glory of God
this hymn, Old Hundred."</div>

<p>The whole congregation instantly rose, and poured
forth the sacred song, in which they were accompanied
by the organ, in a style of simple grandeur and
heartfelt devotion that was probably never surpassed.
By the time the hymn was finished the storm was
hushed. The remainder of the services were well
adapted to sustain the elevated feeling which had
been produced; and the benediction with which the
good man dismissed the flock was universally received
with streaming eyes, and hearts overflowing with tenderness
and gratitude.</p>

<p>Another writer has thus described his appearance
in the pulpit. There was nothing in the appearance
of this extraordinary man which would lead you to
suppose that a Felix would tremble before him. He
was something above the middle stature, well proportioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
and remarkable for a native gracefulness of
manner. His complexion was very fair, his features
regular, and his dark blue eyes small and lively. In
recovering from the measles he had contracted a
squint with one of them; but this peculiarity rather
rendered the expression of his countenance more remarkable,
than in any degree lessened the effect of its
uncommon sweetness. His voice excelled both in
melody and compass; and its fine modulations were
happily accompanied by that grace of action which
he possessed in an eminent degree, and which has
been said to be the chief requisite in an orator. To
see him when he first commenced, one would have
thought him any thing but enthusiastic and glowing;
but as he proceeded, his heart warmed with his subject,
and his manner became impetuous and animated;
till, forgetful of every thing around him, he seemed to
kneel at the throne of Jehovah, and to beseech in
agony for his fellow-beings.</p>

<p>After he had finished his prayer, he knelt for a
long time in profound silence, and so powerful was
the effect on the most heartless of his audience, that a
stillness like that of the tomb pervaded the whole
house.</p>

<p>Mr. Tracy, in his narrative of "the Great Awakening"
about 1740, has admirably remarked, "It is
often said that Whitefield cannot have been a very
great man, because his printed sermons contain only
plain, common thoughts, such as men of ordinary
minds habitually use. But what made those thoughts
so common? They were not common when he began
to utter them. In England especially, and to a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
extent here also, they astonished his hearers
by their strangeness. What is more common than a
voyage across the Atlantic? But was Columbus,
therefore, only an ordinary man? The case of Copernicus
is more nearly parallel. He reasserted a
truth which had been uttered, repudiated, and forgotten.
That truth is now common, even among
school-boys. But was he, therefore, only a child in
intellect?"</p>

<p>There are yet extant about eighty of the sermons
by which Whitefield agitated nations, and the more
remote influence of which is still distinctly to be
traced, in the popular divinity and national character
of Great Britain and of the United States. Of these
compositions, Sir James Stephen, an evangelical Episcopalian
of London, wrote at some length in the
"Edinburgh Review," 1838, and we shall make no
apology for borrowing a portion of his remarks, combining
them with some of our own.</p>

<p>It is true, that these sermons have fallen into very
general neglect; for to win permanent acceptance
for a book, into which the principles of life were not
infused by its author, is a miracle which not even the
zeal of religious proselytes can accomplish. Yet, inferior
as were his inventive to his mimetic powers,
Whitefield is entitled, among theological writers, to
a place which, if it cannot challenge admiration, may
at least excite and reward curiosity. Many, and those
by far the worst of his discourses, bear the marks of
careful preparation. Take at hazard a sermon of one
of the preachers usually distinguished as evangelical,
add a little to its length, and subtract a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
from its point and polish, and you have one of his
more elaborate common topics discussed in a commonplace
way; a respectable mediocrity of thought and
style; endless variations on one or two cardinal
truths&mdash;in short, the task of a clerical Saturday evening,
executed with piety, good sense, and exceeding
sedateness. But open one of that series of Whitefield's
sermons which bears the stamp of having been
conceived and uttered at the same moment, and imagine
it recited to myriads of eager listeners with every
charm of voice and gesture, and the secret of his
unrivalled fascination is at least partially disclosed.
He places himself on terms of intimacy and unreserved
confidence with you, and makes it almost as
difficult to decline the invitation to his familiar talk
as if Montaigne himself had issued it. The egotism
is amusing, affectionate, and warm-hearted, with just
that slight infusion of self-importance without which
it would pass for affectation. In his art of rhetoric,
personification holds the first place; and the prosopop&oelig;ia
is so managed as to quicken abstractions into
life, and to give them individuality and distinctness
without the exhibition of any of those spasmodic and
distorted images which obey the incantations of vulgar
exorcists. Every trace of study and contrivance
is obliterated by the hearty earnestness which pervades
each successive period, and by the vernacular
and homely idioms in which his meaning is conveyed.</p>

<p>It is in the grandeur and singleness of purpose
that the charm of Whitefield's preaching seems to
have consisted. You feel that you have to do with
a man who lived and spoke, and who would gladly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
have died, to deter his hearers from the path of destruction,
and to guide them to holiness and peace. His
gossipping stories, and dramatic forms of speech, are
never employed to hide the awful realities on which
he is intent. Conscience is not permitted to find an
intoxicating draught in even spiritual excitement, or
an anodyne in glowing imagery. Guilt and its punishment,
pardon and spotless purity, death and an
eternal existence, stand out in bold relief on every
page. From these the eye of the teacher is never
withdrawn, and to these the attention of the hearer is
riveted. All that is poetic, grotesque, or rapturous
is employed to deepen these impressions, and is dismissed
as soon as that purpose is answered. Deficient
in learning, meagre in thought, and redundant in language
as are these discourses, they yet fulfil the one
great condition of genuine eloquence. They propagate
their own kindly warmth, and leave their stings
behind them.</p>

<p>The enumeration of the sources of Whitefield's power
is still essentially defective. Neither energy, nor
eloquence, nor histrionic talents, nor any artifices of
style, nor the most genuine sincerity and self-devotedness,
nor all these united, would have enabled him to
mould the religious character of millions in his own
and future generations. The secret lies deeper. It
consisted in the theology he taught&mdash;in its perfect
simplicity and universal application. "Would ministers,"
says he, "preach for eternity, they would then
act the part of true Christian orators; and not only
calmly and coolly inform the understanding, but by
pathetic and persuasive address, endeavor to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the affections and to warm the heart. To act otherwise,
betrays a sad ignorance of human nature, and
such an inexcusable ignorance and indifference in a
preacher, as must constrain the hearers to suspect,
whether they will or not, that the preacher, let him
be whom he will, only deals in the false commerce of
unfelt truth." His eighteen thousand sermons were
but so many variations on two key-notes: man is
guilty, but may obtain forgiveness; he is immortal,
and must ripen here for endless weal or woe hereafter.
Expanded into innumerable forms, and diversified by
infinite varieties of illustration, these two cardinal
principles were ever in his heart and on his tongue.
Let who would invoke poetry to embellish the Christian
system, or philosophy to explore its esoteric
depths, from his lips it was delivered as an awful and
urgent summons to repent, to believe, and to obey.
To set to music the orders issued to seamen in a
storm, or to address them in the language of Aristotle
or Descartes, would have seemed to him not a
whit more preposterous than to divert his hearers
from their danger and their refuge, their duties and
their hopes, to any topics more trivial or more abstruse.
In fine, he was thoroughly and continually
in earnest, and therefore possessed that tension of
the soul which admitted neither of lassitude nor relaxation,
few and familiar as were the topics to which
he was confined. His was, therefore, precisely that
state of mind in which alone eloquence, properly so
called, can be engendered, and a moral and intellectual
sovereignty won.</p>

<p>Nor less important is it to remark, though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
need not illustrate it at length, that much was effected
by every one seeing that he always forgot himself
in his subject, and rested only on heaven for success.
He felt himself called to serve Christ, and gave himself
to his task, to save sinners, and he cared for
nothing else. No one ever doubted his sincerity
when he prayed, "Help me, Friend of sinners, to be
nothing, to say nothing, that thou mayest say and do
every thing, and be my all in all." If the same feelings
were fully shown by the ministry at present,
our messages would tell more on the hearts of our
hearers.</p>

<p>We need hardly remind the reader that Whitefield
was remarkable for <em>a devotional spirit</em>. Probably
no man ever lived nearer to God. Had he been less
prayerful, he would have been less powerful. It has
been said that during a few of the last years of his
life he read the voluminous exposition of Matthew
Henry, comprising six quarto volumes, in a kneeling
posture, pausing and praying that God would engraft
upon his mind the instructions of that extraordinary
man. When he came before his auditors, he looked
like one who had been with God. This it was which
won for him the title of <em>seraphic</em>&mdash;he was a human
<em>seraph</em>, and burnt out in the blaze of his own fire.
Usually for an hour or two before he went into the
pulpit, he claimed retirement. In this claim he was
imperative, and would not be interrupted in his seasons
of hallowed intercourse with God.</p>

<p>Engaged almost incessantly in preaching, or in
preparation for it, it was impossible, however much
he desired it, to pay many private visits of a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
nature. We are told, however, that on one occasion,
when a young minister, afterwards exceedingly
popular and useful, was once visiting him, he was
sent for to visit a poor woman who had been so
dreadfully burnt that she could not survive many
hours. He went immediately, and prayed with her.
He had no sooner returned, than she called out, "Oh,
where is Mr. Whitefield?" Urged by her entreaty,
her friends requested him to visit her a second time.
He complied, and again prayed with her. The poor
afflicted woman continued still to desire his presence.
When her friends came for him a third time, "I begged
of him," said the young clergyman, "not to go; for
he could scarcely expect to do any good. 'Your
nerves are too weak, your feelings are too acute to
endure such scenes.' I shall never forget his mild
reproof: 'Leave me; my Master can save to the uttermost,
to the <em>very uttermost</em>.'"</p>

<p>In conversation with his friends, Whitefield was
as far removed as possible from duplicity and mere
compliment. He invited from his friends whatever of
instruction and of reproof they considered him to
need. And while he was always ready to receive reproof,
he was, when called to the duty, ready to give
it, and often in a way which his friends did not expect.
A censorious professor of religion, knowing the doctrinal
differences between the two men, asked Whitefield
if he thought they would see Mr. John Wesley
in heaven. His answer was truly admirable: "No,
sir, I fear not; for he will be so near the throne, and
we shall be at such a distance, we shall hardly get
sight of him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said, that when he was once travelling in
company with a Christian man, they had occasion to
stay for a night at a road-side tavern. After they
had retired, they were greatly annoyed by a company
of gamblers, who were in an adjoining room. Whitefield
could not rest, and told his friend that he would
go into the room and reprove them for their conduct.
The other remonstrated against his doing so, but in
vain. He went; and unhappily, his words fell apparently
powerless upon them. Returning, he laid down
to sleep. "What," asked his companion, "did you
gain by your trouble?" Whitefield characteristically
answered, "A soft pillow."</p>

<p>In his intercourse with general society, Mr. Whitefield
never forgot his dignity as a servant of Jesus
Christ. When he was in the zenith of his popularity,
Lord Clare, who knew that his influence was considerable,
applied to him by letter, requesting his influence
at Bristol at the ensuing general election. To
this request Mr. Whitefield replied, that in general
elections he never interfered; but he would earnestly
exhort his lordship to use great diligence to make his
own particular "calling and election sure."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield was greatly distinguished, even
from early life, for neatness in his person, order in
his apartments, and regular method in the management
of all his affairs. He was accustomed to say
that a minister should be "without a spot;" and on
one occasion remarked, that he could not feel comfortable
if he knew that his <em>gloves</em> were out of their proper
place. The advantages of such habits are numerous.
They save time, give a degree of comfort which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
only be known by experience, and add not a little to
the dignity of the Christian minister.</p>

<p>The device upon Whitefield's seal, of which probably
few impressions are now to be found, was truly
characteristic. It was a winged heart soaring above
the globe, and its motto was, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astra petamus</i>"&mdash;Let
us seek heaven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>CHARACTER OF WHITEFIELD AS A PREACHER&mdash;CENTENNIAL
COMMEMORATIONS.</h3>


<p>In suggesting a few of the <span class="smcap">characteristics of
Whitefield's preaching</span>, we are very greatly indebted
to an excellent anonymous writer in the London
Evangelical Magazine for 1853. We consider as
among the reasons of his success, and as worthy of
our imitation,</p>

<p>First, <em>the prominence given to the leading truths of
salvation, and the constant exaltation of Christ in them</em>.
There needs no minute inquiry, or great analytical
care, to ascertain what was the pervading theme of
this popular minister: it was "Christ, and him crucified,"
and the glorious truths that hover around the
cross, and derive from it their being and lustre.
There was no other subject, in Whitefield's estimation,
that was worthy of pre&#235;minence, and to unfold, elucidate,
and apply it, was the great design of his labors.
He saw in it such a wonderful adaptation to the
necessities and condition of fallen humanity, that he
stood in the midst of its wants and woes with all the
confidence of a good physician who had a sovereign
and sufficient remedy to propose. He knew that
there was no case which it could not meet, no moral
disease from which it would not recover, no spiritual
need which it would not supply; and therefore, however
far gone men might be from original righteousness,
however hardened in sin, sunk in iniquity, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
however elevated by the delusions of a false morality
and fancied self-righteousness, he propounded this as
the only and all-sufficient antidote, at once to destroy
and heal, to kill and to make alive. As to the spurious
production of a rationalistic theory on the one
hand, or the prescriptions of ceremonial virtue and
sacramental grace on the other, he knew them not.
He saw at once their hollowness and insufficiency,
and would not mock the necessities of our fallen nature,
or aggravate the wounds which sin had made by
a proposal of them. His acquaintance with the human
heart was deep, and his knowledge of the different
modifications of the original disease was so great,
that he despaired of relief from any expedients save
that which infinite Wisdom had devised, and which
"the gospel of the grace of God" revealed. Philosophy
with all its discoveries, and reason with all its
powers, the law with all its authority, and virtue
with all its rewards, he knew could only, like the
priests and the Levites, have passed the patient by,
and left him to despair, till a greater than they should
arrive, and say, "I will come and heal you." On that
adorable Personage, therefore, and the wonders of his
skill and love, he delighted to dwell. Every sermon
was full of Christ; every discourse was odorous of
him. From whatever part of revealed truth he derived
his text, and with whatever peculiar development
of man's moral physiology he had to do, there
was something to suggest, to demonstrate the need,
or the suitableness, or the all-sufficiency of the Saviour
of the world. To set him forth, in the glories of his
wonderful person, the variety of his offices, the perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
of his righteousness, the completeness of his
atonement, and the plenitude of his grace, was his
perpetual aim. To these he gave continual prominence,
at all times, and in every place. There was
no reserve, no equivocation, no partial statement on
such themes. It was a full, clear, consistent gospel.
From his lips the gospel gave no "uncertain sound."
This made him a welcome messenger of glad tidings
to all. This gave him a key to the hearts of many,
who, as they stood around him, and wondered at him,
like those five thousand whom the Redeemer fed with
"five loaves and two small fishes," found all their
appetites suited, and all their necessities supplied.
It was the magic power which arrested them; the
centre of gravitation which attracted them; the bread
of life which fed them. "As Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness," so now was the Son of man
lifted up by the ministry of this his devoted herald;
and far as the camp extended, and wide as the circumference
of poison and death was spread, the wounded
looked thereon and lived. A restorative virtue issued
from it. The hardest heart was softened. The most
obstinate in rebellion was overcome. The blindest
saw. The moral lepers were cleansed. The broken
in heart were made whole, and the spiritually dead
were raised to life. "This was the Lord's doing, and
it was marvellous in their eyes." They beheld the
man. They heard him preach. They felt the power.
It was because He was exalted among them who had
said, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw
all men unto me."</p>

<p>Secondly, <em>the glow of feeling, the melting compassion,</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
<em>which pervaded his own soul</em>. Oh, it is supremely
delightful and deeply affecting to observe the tender
affection and melting pathos with which Whitefield
propounded and proclaimed the precious truths and
everlasting verities of the gospel to his fellow-men.
He stood among them as one of their race, one of their
number, conscious of the common misery into which
all had fallen, and weeping over the miseries and ruin
in which by nature they were alike involved. As he
opened up the treasures of infinite mercy, and the
riches of redeeming love to their view, he wept to
think how long they had been unknown or despised
by many, and with what base ingratitude thousands
would probably still turn away from them. As one
who saw their immortal being in jeopardy, and their
souls standing on the verge of irretrievable ruin, he
hastened, with joy in his countenance and tenderness
in his heart, to tell them of One who was "mighty to
save," and that "now was the accepted time, and now
the day of salvation." Not as one who had a cold
lecture on ethics to deliver, or a dissertation on philosophy
to expound, or a problem in mathematics to
solve, did he proceed to such a work; but as one who
felt the weight of his great commission, and knew the
worth of never-dying souls. The evil of sin, the danger
of impenitence, the powers of the world to come,
the glories of heaven, and the unutterable miseries of
the regions of woe, were visibly present to his own
mind; and of these, "out of the abundance of his
heart," he spoke to others. He could not be calm,
he could not be apathetic on such themes as these.</p>

<p class="center">
"Passion was reason, transport temper, here."
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<div class="noindent">And with much of the melting tenderness of Him
who wept over Jerusalem, he spoke of these things
to all that resorted to him. What moving words did
he utter on Blackheath hill, in the Tabernacle pulpit,
and on Kingswood mount! His vivid eye beamed
with the glow of tenderness, and his tears, as he
spoke, oft-times moistened his little Bible or bedewed
the ground. In his printed sermons, which doubtless
are but feeble specimens of his free and fervent manner,
there are strains of tender pathos and impassioned
oratory, which it is almost impossible to read
even now without being moved to share in his feelings
and in the emotions which they must have enkindled
around; and in the perusal of which we
wonder not that, in all the circumstances, the place
in which he stood was a Bochim&mdash;a place of weeping.
Oh, the melting power, the exquisite pathos, the tender
expostulation of this pre&#235;minent man, and unrivalled
preacher of the gospel of our salvation! We
wish we could catch them now&mdash;that all preachers
possessed them; that the rising ministry especially
would emulate him in these things. Whitefield showed
his intense feeling, not from the mere power of
ratiocination, or from the poetic memento, or for the
sake of producing effect by the tears that were unfelt,
or which only flowed from the surface; but from the
meltings of a tender heart, influenced by a Saviour's
love, and overflowing with the commiseration of a
benign compassion for dying multitudes around. Doddridge's
beautiful hymn,</div>

<p class="center">
"Arise, my tenderest thoughts, arise,"
</p>

<div class="noindent">one might almost think was written at Whitefield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
side. The tenderness of John, and the "weeping" of
Paul, were blended in him with the boldness of Peter.
The love that agonized in the garden of Gethsemane,
and bled on the cross of Calvary, was largely diffused
through all his powers.</div>

<p>Thirdly, <em>the direct address of his ministry</em>. The
characteristic mode of his preaching, and the style of
his public ministrations, was, to direct his appeal to
the hearts and consciences of his hearers, and to
"preach <em>to</em> the people all the words of this life." It
was not an harangue <em>before</em> them. It was not an
oration beautifully prepared, read, or delivered in
their hearing, and presented simply for their acceptance
and admiration; but a direct address, an affectionate
appeal, a solemn and earnest communication
of the message he had received from God to them.
Oh, we have sometimes thought, what a marked difference
there ought to be between the ministrations of
a servant of Christ to his fellow-immortals, on things
of eternal importance in which they are personally
and deeply concerned, and the delivery of a lecture
from the philosopher's desk, or even of a dissertation
on theology from the professorial chair. So thought
the apostles. So thought the prophets and public
teachers of sacred mysteries of old. They had the
"burden of the Lord" to deliver, and it was <em>unto</em> the
people. They had an embassy to execute, and it was
by negotiating directly with, and in the consciences
of their hearers. Whitefield caught their spirit, proceeded
in their way, and did such mighty execution,
not by the mere symmetrical illustration of divine
truth, but by the direct presentation of it to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
minds. They had not to ask, "For whom is all this
intended?" and, "Is it designed for us?" They felt
that it was. It came home to their consciences, and
to their very hearts. They could not transfer it to
others, nor avoid the application of it to themselves.
Had the preacher called them by name, which in his
skilful delineation of character, he sometimes virtually
did, they could not have been more certain that he
intended it for them, and that it was at their peril to
neglect or pass it by. "I have a message from God
unto thee," he substantially said in every discourse he
uttered, and the people were compelled to believe it.
"Go, and tell this people," said the divine voice to
Isaiah, "Ye hear indeed, but do not understand; ye
see indeed, but do not perceive." "Therefore," said
Peter, "let all the house of Israel know assuredly that
God hath made that same Jesus, <em>whom ye have crucified</em>,
both Lord and Christ." "Now then," said Paul,
"we are ambassadors for Christ; as though God did
beseech <em>you</em> by us, we pray <em>you</em>, in Christ's stead, <em>be
ye</em> reconciled to God." Such was the tenor of the
apostolic ministry. Such the secret of its mighty
power and success. And such also was the characteristic
of the faithful and seraphic Whitefield, by
which he knocked at the door of many hearts, and
those hearts were opened to him, to his message, and
to his Lord. His plan was that of heavenly wisdom;
his appeal was the same. "Unto you, O men, I call,
and my voice is to the sons of men." In him were
verified the poet's graphic lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"There stands the messenger of truth; there stands<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The legate of the skies: his theme divine,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
<span class="i1">His office sacred, his credentials clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By him the violated law speaks out<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its thunders; and by him, in strains as sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As angels use, the gospel whispers peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sues the sinner to return to God."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Fourthly, <em>his habitual dependence on the Spirit of
God, and his earnest aspirations for the manifestation of
his power</em>. That he was conscious of his own superior
talents as an orator, and knew how to employ them on
sacred themes; that he skilfully wielded all the weapons
of a well-studied eloquence to gain access to the
human mind, and knew both how to alarm and how to
persuade, and could attempt both with as much success
probably as any speaker, either of ancient or modern
times; that he had a large and minute acquaintance
with the powers and passions of the human soul, and
knew well when and how to touch the hidden springs
of its energies and actions; that he had a good amount
of common and sacred learning at his command, and
like that Apollos whom among the early teachers of
Christianity he most resembled, was "mighty in the
Scriptures;" and that he delighted to expatiate on
the wonders and glories of redemption as a restorative
scheme pre&#235;minently adapted to interest and attract,
to impress and rule our common nature&mdash;are facts
open to all who inspect his writings and accompany
him in his labors, and will be denied by none. But
with all these, and amid all, in every sermon he composed
and delivered, and in his most impassioned
addresses to his hearers, there is manifested an underlying
and all-pervading dependence on the power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
grace of the Spirit of God, which was in character, if
not in degree, meek, humble, genuine, entire, like that
of the most eminent apostle or adoring saint at the
foot of the divine throne. With him it was not
merely a sentiment, but a feeling; and that feeling
constant and habitual, as it was in him who in the
review of his labors said, "I have planted, Apollos
watered, but God gave the increase." He knew that
none but the almighty Spirit could gain effectual
access to the spirit of man; and that not even a Melancthon,
a Luther, or a Whitefield, could make old
Adam yield, unless constrained by a superior power.
He seemed to stand in the valley of vision among the
dry bones, as the prophet did, and while he addressed
them with something like a prophet's power, he had
no expectation or hope of success until the wind of
heaven came down and blew upon them. Therefore
he prophesied to it as well as to them. "Come from
the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon the slain,
that they may live," was often the mighty cry of his
soul, before preaching, while preaching, and after
preaching. It seemed to be his joy, his only, his all-sustaining
confidence, that he lived under "the dispensation
of the Spirit," and wrought in a day, and
preached upon a theme, in connection with which "the
ministration of the Spirit" was to be "glorious," by
his wonderful works of conviction, conversion, and
sanctification, among the children of men. To that
Spirit, as the glorifier of Christ, he often devoutly
and earnestly appealed. Sometimes, in the midst of
an unusual flow of tender and eloquent address to his
hearers on his favorite theme of the glories and grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
of his divine Master, he would pause in solemn silence,
and lifting up his hands and his voice to heaven, and
carrying the hearts of his audience with him, invoke
aloud the descending and all-consuming fire. The
present God was acknowledged and felt. The word
came "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power."
And while the habitual aim of his preaching was to
exalt "Christ Jesus the Lord," and while he reasoned,
and opened the Scriptures, and taught and alarmed
or invited his hearers, in the most touching strains of
urgent remonstrance and tender entreaty, to accept
now "the great salvation," the inward state of his soul
was that of entire reliance on the presence and co&#246;peration
of the Holy Spirit of God. To him were
sent up his most intense aspirations. In all the records
of his success, to that Spirit the honor is always
ascribed. "Not I, but the grace of God which was
with me," is the grateful acknowledgment he makes in
the review of every field occupied and every triumph
won. And thus it was that the fabric of his ministry,
and of all his ministrations, in the multitudinous labors
which he directed against the kingdom of darkness
and of Satan in his day, was like the mystic
vision which Ezekiel saw, <em>instinct with life</em>. The spirit
of the living creatures was in the wheels. "When
this went, those went; when this stood, those stood;
when this was lifted up from the earth, those were
lifted up." It was all life. A living preacher; a living
theme; a living power, giving life, and spreading
it all around. Therefore it was that life followed in
the region of death, and at his coming the desert rejoiced,
and the wilderness blossomed as the rose.</p>

<span class="i0">"Dry bones were raised, and clothed afresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hearts of stone were turned to flesh."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>By preaching such as we have now attempted to
describe, thousands and tens of thousands were gathered
to Christ. "An exceeding great army" stood up.
Slumbering churches were awakened, religion was
revived, and "righteousness and praise" were caused
to "spring forth before all the nations." And as this
apostolic man surveyed the amazing scene, and glanced
at the wide circumference of his labors, in the British
Isles and in the New World, he might have exclaimed,
as one before him had done, "Now thanks be unto
God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and
maketh manifest the savor of his name by us in every
place." "Through mighty signs and wonders, <em>by the
power of the Spirit of God</em>, from Jerusalem round
about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel
of Christ." "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation; to the
Jew first, and also to the Greek." Who, in the remembrance
of Whitefield and his times, will not long for
their return, and exclaim, "Awake, awake; put on
strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient
days." "O that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that
thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might
flow down at thy presence, as when the melting fire
burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make
thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations
may tremble at thy presence!" Spirit of the living
God, descend and replenish with thy power all our
souls, our ministry, our temples, our land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>In estimating the character of Whitefield, it should
be observed that <em>he dealt with his hearers, individually
and collectively, as immortal beings</em>. To use the language
of Isaac Taylor, "he held <small>MAN</small> as if in the abstract,
or as if whatever is not common to all men
were forgotten. The most extreme diversities, intellectual
and moral, differences of rank, culture, national
modes of thought, all gave way and ceased to be
thought of; distinctions were swept from the ground
where he took his position. At the first opening of
his lips, and as the rich harmony of his voice spread
its undulations over the expanse of human faces, and
at the instant when the sparkle of his bright eye
caught every other eye, human nature, in a manner,
dropped its individuality, and presented itself in its
very elements to be moulded anew. Whitefield,
although singularly gifted with a perception of the
varieties of character, yet spoke as if he could know
nothing of the thousands before him but their immortality
and their misery; and so it was that these
thousands listened to him.</p>

<p>"No preacher whose history is on record, has trod
so wide a field as did Whitefield, or has retrod it so
often, or has repeated himself so much, or has carried
so far the experiment of exhausting himself, and of
spending his popularity, if it could have been spent,
but it never was spent. Within the compass of a few
weeks he might have been heard addressing the negroes
of the Bermuda islands, adapting himself to
their infantile understandings, and to their debauched
hearts; and then at Chelsea, with the aristocracy of
rank and wit before him, approving himself to listeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
such as the lords Bolingbroke and Chesterfield.
Whitefield might as easily have produced a Hamlet
or a Paradise Lost, as have excogitated a sermon
which, as a composition, a product of thought, would
have tempted men like these to hear him a second
time; and as to his faculty and graces as a speaker,
his elocution and action, a second performance would
have contented them. But in fact Bolingbroke, and
many of his class, thought not the hour long, time
after time, while, with much sameness of <em>material</em> and
of language, he spoke of eternity and of salvation in
Christ.... Floods of tears moistened cheeks rough
and smooth; and sighs, suppressed or loudly uttered,
gave evidence that human nature is one and the same
when it comes in presence of truths which bear upon
the guilty and the immortal without distinction."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. Dr. James Hamilton of London has admirably
delineated Whitefield, in a passage which must
be admired by all who read it: "Whitefield was the
prince of English preachers. Many have surpassed
him as sermon-makers, but none have approached him
as a pulpit orator. Many have outshone him in the
clearness of their logic, the grandeur of their conceptions,
and the sparkling beauty of single sentences;
but in the power of darting the gospel direct into the
conscience, he eclipsed them all. With a full and
beaming countenance, and the frank and easy port
which the English people love&mdash;for it is the symbol
of honest purpose and friendly assurance&mdash;he combined
a voice of rich compass, which could easily thrill
over Moorfields in musical thunder, or whisper its terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
secret in every private ear; and to this gainly
aspect and tuneful voice he added a most expressive
and eloquent action. Improved by conscientious practice,
and instinct with his earnest nature, this elocution
was the acted sermon, and by its pantomimic
portrait enabled the eye to anticipate each rapid
utterance, and helped the memory to treasure up the
palatable ideas. None ever used so boldly, nor with
more success, the highest styles of impersonation: as
when he described to his sailor-auditors a storm at
sea, and compelled them to shout, 'Take to the longboat,
sir!' His 'hark, hark!' could conjure up Gethsemane
with its faltering moon, and awake again the
cry of horror-stricken innocence; and an apostrophe
to Peter on the holy mount would light up another
Tabor, and drown it in glory from the opening heaven.
His thoughts were possessions, and his feelings
were transformations; and he spoke because he felt,
his hearers understood because they saw. They were
not only enthusiastic amateurs, like Garrick, who ran
to weep and tremble at his bursts of passion, but even
the colder critics of the Walpole school were surprised
into momentary sympathy and reluctant wonder.
Lord Chesterfield was listening in Lady Huntingdon's
pew when Whitefield was comparing the benighted
sinner to a blind beggar on a dangerous road. His
little dog gets away from him when skirting the edge
of a precipice, and he is left to explore the path with
his iron-shod staff. On the very verge of the cliff this
blind guide slips through his fingers and skims away
down the abyss. All unconscious, the owner stoops
down to regain it, and stumbling forward&mdash;'Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
God, he is gone!' shouted Chesterfield, who had been
watching with breathless alarm the blind man's movements,
and who jumped from his feet to save the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"But the glory of Whitefield's preaching was his
heart-kindled and heart-melting gospel. But for
this, all his bold strokes and brilliant surprises might
have been no better than the rhetorical triumphs of
Kirwan and other pulpit dramatists. He was an orator,
but he only sought to be an evangelist. Like a
volcano where gold and gems may be darted forth as
well as common things, but where gold and molten
granite flow all alike in fiery fusion, bright thoughts
and splendid images might be projected from his pulpit,
but all were merged in the stream which bore
along the gospel and himself in blended fervor. Indeed,
so simple was his nature, that glory to God and
good will to man had filled it; there was room for little
more. Having no church to found, no family to
enrich, and no memory to immortalize, he was simply
the ambassador of God; and inspired with its genial
piteous spirit&mdash;so full of heaven reconciled and humanity
restored&mdash;he soon himself became a living
gospel. Radiant with its benignity, and trembling
with its tenderness, by a sort of spiritual induction a
vast audience would speedily be brought into a frame
of mind&mdash;the transfusing of his own; and the white
furrows on their sooty faces told that Kingswood colliers
were weeping, or the quivering of an ostrich
plume bespoke its elegant wearer's deep emotion.
And coming to his pulpit direct from communion with
his Master, and in the strength of accepted prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
there was an elevation in his mien which often paralyzed
hostility, and a self-possession which made him
amid uproar and confusion the more sublime. With
an electric bolt he would bring the jester in his fool's
cap from his perch on the tree, or galvanize the brickbat
from the skulking miscreant's grasp, or sweep
down in crouching submission and shamefaced silence
the whole of Bartholomew fair; while a revealing
flash of sententious doctrine, of vivified Scripture,
would disclose to awe-struck hundreds the forgotten
verities of another world, or the unsuspected arcana
of their inner man. 'I came to break your head, but,
through you, God has broken my heart,' was a sort
of confession with which he was familiar; and to see
the deaf old gentlewoman who used to mutter imprecations
at him as he passed along the streets, clambering
up the pulpit stairs to catch his angelic words,
was a sort of spectacle which the triumphant gospel
often witnessed in his day. And when it is known
that his voice could be heard by twenty thousand, and
that ranging all the empire, as well as America, he
would often preach thrice on a working-day, and that
he has received in one week as many as a thousand
letters from persons awakened by his sermons, if no
estimate can be formed of the results of his ministry,
some idea may be suggested of its vast extent and
singular effectiveness."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very admirably has a writer in the North British
Review compared and contrasted Whitefield and Wesley.
He says, "Few characters could be more completely
the converse, and in the church's exigencies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
more happily the supplement of one another, than
were those of George Whitefield and John Wesley;
and had their views been identical, and their labors
all along coincident, their large services to the gospel
might have repeated Paul and Barnabas. Whitefield
was soul, and Wesley was system. Whitefield was a
summer cloud which burst at morning or noon a fragrant
exhalation over an ample track, and took the
rest of the day to gather again; Wesley was the polished
conduit in the midst of the garden, through
which the living water glided in pearly brightness
and perennial music, the same vivid stream from day
to day. After a preaching paroxysm, Whitefield lay
panting on his couch, spent, breathless, and deathlike;
after his morning sermon in the foundry, Wesley
would mount his pony, and trot and chat, and gather
simples, till he reached some country hamlet, where
he would bait his charger, and talk through a little
sermon with the villagers, and remount his pony and
trot away again. In his a&#235;rial poise, Whitefield's
eagle eye drank lustre from the source of light, and
loved to look down on men in assembled myriads;
Wesley's falcon glance did not sweep so far, but it
searched more keenly and marked more minutely
where it pierced. A master of assemblies, Whitefield
was no match for the isolated man. Seldom coping
with the multitude, but strong in astute sagacity and
personal ascendency, Wesley could conquer any number
one by one. All force and impetus, Whitefield
was the powder-blast in the quarry, and by one explosive
sermon would shake a district, and detach materials
for other men's long work&mdash;deft, neat, and painstaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
Wesley loved to split and trim each fragment
into uniform plinths and polished stones. Or, taken
otherwise, Whitefield was the bargeman or the wagoner
who brought the timber of the house, and Wesley
was the architect who set it up. Whitefield had no
patience for ecclesiastical polity, no aptitude for pastoral
details&mdash;with a beaver-like propensity for building,
Wesley was always constructing societies, and
with a king-like craft of ruling, was most at home
when presiding over a class or a conference. It was
their infelicity that they did not always work together&mdash;it
was the happiness of the age, and the furtherance
of the gospel, that they lived alongside of one
another."</p>


<p class="center">CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIONS.</p>

<p>When a century had elapsed from the commencement
of Whitefield's public labors, it was deemed desirable
by many in England to hold public services
of a devotional and practical character, in celebration
of the event. Especially was it designed that such
celebrations should have a reference, as far as possible,
to advance open-air preaching. The first services of
this character were very properly held in the Tabernacle,
London, on May 21, 1839, and well do we
remember with what intense interest, in common with
thousands, we attended them. Ministers and laymen
of at least four religious denominations assisted in
them, and eloquently discoursed on subjects illustrating
the grace of God in connection with Whitefield,
but still more intent were they on benefiting the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
and future generations of men. Dr. Campbell
delivered a sermon on the character and labors of
Apollos, illustrated by those of Whitefield; the late
Dr. Cox discoursed on the genius and labors of Whitefield;
the late Rev. John Blackburn described the past
and present state of religion in England; and the Rev.
John Young, LL. D., urged the propriety, duty, and
necessity of open-air preaching. In addition to these
sermons, several admirable speeches were made, and
every thing was marked by a spirit of earnest devotion.
A small volume, containing the sermons and
speeches, was printed, and put into extensive circulation.</p>

<p>About the same time, a number of ministers of the
Congregational order met in a central town of Gloucestershire,
when one of them suggested, that "as the
present year was the centenary of the Rev. George
Whitefield's labors in reviving the apostolic practice
of open-air preaching, it might be desirable to commemorate
them by a special religious open-air celebration.
It was further remarked, that Whitefield was
a native of Gloucester; that as many ministers present
presided over churches instituted by his ministry;
that as Stinchcombe hill, in the very centre of the
county, presented a most beautiful and eligible spot
for a public meeting; and as upon its summit, a century
ago, Whitefield himself had preached and showed
the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, it seemed a
duty to improve the opportunity it offered of addressing,
on the gracious persuasives of the cross, a large
concourse of persons, many of whom might never hear
the gospel, and of promoting in the county the revival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of evangelical religion, which God so highly honored
his devoted servant in commencing in our land."</p>

<p>The suggestion was most cordially received, arrangements
were made, and, July 30, 1839, though the
weather was unfavorable, the meeting was attended
by at least seven thousand persons. A large preaching
stand was erected for the ministers, nearly one
hundred of whom were present. Sermons were
preached by the Rev. Drs. Matheson and Ross, and by
the Rev. Messrs. T. East, J. H. Hinton, and J. Sibree;
and addresses were given, and the devotional exercises
led by many others. The services were solemnly impressive.
The late Josiah Conder, Esq., wrote two
hymns especially for the occasion, which are well
worthy of preservation; we therefore transfer them
to our pages.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to add to this account, that satisfactory
evidences were given that some, during these services,
were brought to the saving knowledge of "the
truth as in Jesus." And it may be mentioned as a
singular circumstance, that an old man one hundred
and three years of age attended on this occasion,
who had been carried in his mother's arms to this
same spot to hear Whitefield preach just a century
before.</p>

<p>The last centenary service to which we shall make
reference, is the one held at the <em>Bristol</em> Tabernacle,
November 25, 1853. The sermon on <cite>The Character
of Whitefield</cite>, by the Rev. John Angell James, was
from the text, "This one thing I do." Phil. 3:13.
In it he said:</p>

<p>"We hear much in our days about the adaptation
of the gospel to the age. There is no word I more
hate or love, dread or desire, according to the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
in, or the purpose for which it is used, than this word
<em>adaptation</em> as applied to preaching. Now, if by adaptation
be meant, more philosophy, and less Christianity;
more of cold abstract intellectualism, and less of
popular, simple, earnest statement of gospel truth;
more profound discussion and artificial elaboration
addressed to the learned few, and less of warm-hearted
appeal to the multitude, may God preserve
us from such adaptation, for it is high-treason
against truth and the salvation of souls. But if by
this be meant a stronger intelligence, a chaster composition,
a sterner logic, a more powerful rhetoric, a
more correct criticism, and a more varied illustration,
but all employed to set forth the gospel as comprehending
those two great words, <em>redemption and
regeneration</em>, let us have it; we need it; and come in
ever such abundance, it will be a blessing.</p>

<p>"Adaptation! the gospel is adaptation, from beginning
to end, to every age of time, and to all conditions
of humanity. It is God's own adaptation. It
is he who knows every ward of the lock of man's
nature, who has constructed this admirable key; and
all the miserable tinkering of a vain and deceitful
philosophy can make no better key, nor can all the
attempts of a philosophizing theology make this key
better fit the wards of the lock.</p>

<p>"Adaptation! was not the gospel in all its purity
and simplicity adapted to human nature as it existed
in commercial, scholastic, philosophical Corinth?
And did not Paul think so when he determined to
know nothing there, but 'Christ, and him crucified?'
Was it not by this very gospel, which many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
are "beginning to imagine is not suited to an intellectual
and philosophical age, that Christianity fought its
first battles, and achieved its victories over the hosts
of darkness? Against the axe, the stake, the sword
of the gladiator, and the lions of the amphitheatre;
against the ridicule of wits, the reasoning of sages,
the interests, influence, and craft of the priesthood;
against the prowess of armies, and the brute passions
of the mob, Christianity, strong in its weakness, sublime
in its simplicity, potent in its isolation, asking
and receiving no protection from the sceptre of the
monarch or the sword of the warrior, went forth to do
battle with the wisdom of Greece and the mythology
of Rome. Everywhere it prevailed, and gathered its
laurels from the snows of Scythia, the sands of Africa,
the plains of India, and the green fields of Europe.
With the gospel alone she overturned the altars of
impiety in her march. Power felt his arm wither at
her glance. She silenced the lying oracles by the
majesty of her voice, and extinguished the deceptive
light of philosophy in the schools, till at length she
who went forth forlorn and weeping from Calvary
to the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, ascended, upon
the ruins of the temples, the idols, and the altars she
had demolished, to the throne of the C&#230;sars, and with
the diadem on her brow, and the purple on her shoulders,
gave laws to the world from that very tribunal
where she had been dragged as a criminal and condemned
as a malefactor.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"Adaptation! is not justification by faith the
very substance of the gospel, and was it not by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
doctrine that Luther effected the enfranchisement of
the human intellect, from the chains of slavery which
had been forged in the Vatican; achieved the liberation
of half Europe from the yoke of Rome, and gave
an impulse to human thought and vital Christianity
which has not yet spent itself, and never will, till it
issues in the jubilee of the nations and the glories of
the millennium?</p>

<p>"Adaptation! did not Whitefield move this kingdom
almost to its centre, and equally so our then
great transatlantic colony to its extremities, fascinating
alike the colliers of Kingswood and the citizens
of the metropolis; and by this mighty theme
enable myriads to burst the chains of sin and Satan,
and to walk abroad disenthralled by the mighty
power of redeeming grace?</p>

<p>"Adaptation! is not this gospel now proving its
power in heathen countries to raise the savage into
civilized man, the civilized man into the saint, and in
this ascending scale of progression, the saint into the
seraph?</p>

<p>"And yet, with these proofs of the power of the
gospel to adapt itself to every age of the world, and
to every condition of humanity, there are those who
want something else to effect the regeneration of
mankind. 'And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all
men unto me.' So said the Saviour of men. The
cross is the great moral magnet for all ages and all
countries, to draw men from barbarism to civilization,
from sin to holiness, from misery to happiness,
and from earth to heaven; and it were as rational to
say the loadstone had lost its original power of polar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
attraction, and the mariner's compass is an old, stale
invention, and must now be replaced with some new
device, better adapted to the modern light of science,
as to suppose that the doctrine of the cross had become
effete, and must give way to some new phase of
theological truth.</p>

<p>"I now consider the <em>manner</em> in which Whitefield
carried out his own purpose into action. '<em>One thing
I do</em>:' and <em>how</em> did he accomplish it?</p>

<p>"Never was the joyful sound sent over the world
by a more magnificent <em>voice</em>. All his biographers
labor, as do the historians of Greece in describing the
power of Demosthenes, to make us understand his
wondrous oratory. Perhaps, after all, that which
gives us the most vivid idea of it is, not the <em>crowds</em>
it attracted, moved, and melted, but that it warmed
the cold and calculating Franklin, and fascinated the
philosophical and sceptical Hume. Heaven rarely
ever gave, or gives to man the faculty of speech in
such perfection. But what is particularly worthy of
notice is, that he trusted not to its native power, but
increased that power by assiduous cultivation. His
matchless elocution was not only an endowment, but
an acquirement. If he preached a sermon twenty
times, he went on to the last improving his method of
delivering it, both as to tones and action; not for
theatrical display&mdash;no man was ever more free from
this&mdash;but to carry out his 'one thing'&mdash;<em>the salvation
of souls</em>. He knew, and deeply and philosophically
entered into the meaning of that text, 'Faith cometh
by hearing;' and he also knew that attentive hearing
comes by the power of speaking. With such a theme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
as the gospel, with such an object as salvation, with
such an aim as eternity, and such a Master to serve
as Christ, he would not give utterance to such subjects,
and for such purposes, in careless and slovenly
speech. He studied to be the orator, that he might
thus pluck souls as brands from the burning. In this
let us imitate him. Of all our faculties, that of speech
is perhaps least cultivated, yet is most susceptible of
cultivation, and pays best for the pains bestowed upon
it. My brethren, speech is the great instrument of
our ministerial labor. Our assault upon the rebel
town of Mansoul is to be carried on, and our entrance
to be effected, to use the language of Bunyan, at ear-gate.
The tongue, rather than the pen, is the weapon
of most of us. For the love of souls, let us endeavor
to be good speakers. With the loftiest themes in the
universe for our subjects, do, do let us endeavor to
speak of them in some measure worthily. It is an
instructive and astounding, and to us humiliating and
disgraceful fact, that the stage-player, whether in
comedy or in tragedy, takes ten times more pains to
give effective utterance to his follies, vices, and passions,
for the amusement of his audience, than we do
to eternal and momentous truths for the salvation of
ours. The stage seems the only arena where the
power of oratory is much studied. Should this be?</p>

<p>"A few characteristics of Whitefield's manner deserve
emphatic mention and particular attention, as
connected with the execution of his one great purpose.
The first I notice is <em>solemnity</em>. He never, as did some
of his followers, degraded the pulpit by making it the
arena of low humor and wit; abounding in anecdote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
and even in action, he was uniformly solemn. His
deep devotional spirit contributed largely to this, for
his piety was the inward fire which supplied the ardor
of his manner. He was eminently a man of prayer;
and had he been less prayerful, he would also have
been less powerful. He came into the pulpit from the
closet, where he had been communing with God, and
could no more trifle with merry humor at such a time
than could Moses when he came down from the mount
to the people; or than the high-priest when he came
out from the blazing symbols of the divine presence
between the cherubim in the holy of holies; or Isaiah
when he saw the Lord of hosts, high and lifted up,
with his train filling the temple. Happily the age
and taste for pulpit buffoonery is gone, I hope never
to return.</p>

<p class="center">
''Tis pitiful to count a gain when you should woo a soul.'
</p>

<p>It was the stamp and impress of eternity upon his
preaching, that gave Whitefield such power. He spoke
like a man that stood upon the borders of the unseen
world, alternately rapt in ecstasy as he gazed upon
the felicities of heaven, and convulsed with terror as
he seemed to hear the howlings of the damned, and
saw the smoke of their torment ascending from the
pit for ever and ever. His maxim was to preach, as
Apelles painted, for eternity, and he said, if ministers
preached for eternity, they would then act the part of
true Christian orators. And tell me, my brethren,
what are all the prettinesses, the beauties, or even
sublimities of human eloquence&mdash;what the similes,
metaphors, and other garniture of rhetoric&mdash;what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
philosophy and intellectualities which many in this
day are aiming at, to move and bow and conquer
the human soul, compared with 'the powers of the
world to come?'</p>

<p>"But there was another characteristic of Whitefield's
manner, and that was its <em>tenderness</em>. Our Lord,
as to his humanity, was a man of sorrows, and therefore
of tears; so was Paul, so was Whitefield. Perhaps
the latter somewhat too much so, at any rate far
too much so for any preacher but himself, and with
him the fountain of his tears was somewhat too full
and flowing. But Oh, what an apology for this, and
what a stroke of pathetic eloquence was that appeal
when on one occasion he said, 'You blame me for
weeping, but how can I help it, when you will not
weep for yourselves, although your immortal souls
are on the verge of destruction, and for aught I know
you are hearing your last sermon, and may never more
have an opportunity to have Christ offered to you.'
Man is an emotional as well as an intellectual creature,
and sympathy is one of the powers of our physical
and mental economy. The passions are of an
infectious nature, and men feel more in a crowd than
in solitude. The adage of the ancient elocutionist is
still true, 'If you wish me to weep, weep yourself.'
Whitefield's tears drew forth those of his audience,
and his pathos softened their hearts for the impressions
of the truth. It is forgotten by many preachers
that they may do much by the heart, as well as by the
head. We are not the teachers of logic, mathematics,
metaphysics, or natural philosophy, which have nothing
to do with the heart, but of religion, the very seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
of which is there; and <em>we</em> address ourselves not only
to the logical, but to the &#230;sthetical part of man's
complex nature. By argument, I know we must convince,
but we must not stop in the judgment, but go
on to reach the heart, and we ourselves must feel as
well as reason. <em>Clear, but cold</em>, is too descriptive of
much modern preaching. It is the frosty moonlight
of a winter's night, not the warm sunshine of a summer's
day. A cold preacher is likely to have cold
hearers. Cold! What, when the love of God, the
death of Christ, the salvation of souls, the felicities
of heaven, and the torments of hell are the theme?
Enthusiasm here is venial, compared with lukewarmness.</p>

<p>"Need I say that <em>earnestness</em> was characteristic of
Whitefield's preaching? Yes, that one word, perhaps,
more than any other in our language, is its epitome.
An intense earnestness marked its whole career, and
was carried to such a pitch as to subject him, as did
that of Paul, to the imputation of madness. The salvation
of souls was so entirely the one thing that
engrossed his soul, his time, his labors, that not a step
deviated from it. Every moment, every day, was an
approximation to it. His devotions, his recreations,
if any such he had, his journeys, his voyages, his sermons,
his correspondence, were all referred to this
one end. His exertions never relaxed for a moment,
and he, with his great compeer Wesley, made the
trial so seldom made, what is the utmost effect which,
in the way of saving souls, may be granted to any one
preacher of the gospel in any age or country.</p>

<p>"What may not be done, and is not done by earnestness?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
It gives <em>some</em> success to any error, however
absurd or enormous, and to any scheme of wickedness,
however flagrant and atrocious. What is it
that has given such success to popery, to infidelity, to
Mormonism? <em>Earnestness.</em> And shall the apostles
and advocates of error be more in earnest than the
friends of truth? Whitefield often quoted Betterton
the player, who affirmed that the stage would soon be
deserted if the actors spoke like the preachers. And
what <em>would</em> empty the play-house, that is, dulness and
coldness, <em>does</em> often empty the meeting-house. 'Mr.
Betterton's answer to a worthy prelate,' says Whitefield,
'is worthy of lasting regard.' When asked how
it is that the clergy, who speak of things <em>real</em>, affected
the people so little, and the players, who speak only
of things imaginary, affected them so much, replied
'My lord, I can assign but one reason&mdash;we players
speak of things imaginary as though they were real,
and too many of the clergy speak of things real as
though they were imaginary.' It is not always so.
Many a preacher, even in our own day, by the unaffected
earnestness of his manner, carries away his
audience upon the tide of his own feeling. They hear
what he says, they see what he feels, his eye helps his
tongue, the workings of his countenance disclose the
feelings of his heart; his manner is a lucid comment
upon his matter, breaks down the limits which words
impose upon the communication of ideas, and gives
them not only an apprehension of the meaning, but a
sense of the importance of his subject, which unimpassioned
language and manner could not have done.</p>

<p>"I name but one thing more as characteristic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
this great man, and which it would be well for us to
imitate, and that is, his <em>dauntless courage</em>. See him not
only facing mobs, defying threats, and even lifting up
his pulpit amid the wild uproar of a London fair, the
boldest achievement that a speaker ever accomplished,
but holding on his noble career unterrified, and working
amid the storm of obloquy that came upon him
from so many quarters. Who that has ever read, can
ever forget Cowper's exquisite description of him?</p>

<p>"What but a guilty cowardice is it, a false and
pusillanimous shame, that keeps us in these days from
some novel and bolder method of aggression upon the
domain of darkness? Are we not wanting here in
that moral courage which would make us, when conscious
of doing right, indifferent to the stare of the
ignorant, and the wonder of the timid; to the shaft
of ridicule, and the malignant censure of the cynic?
How enslaved are we by the fetters of custom, or restrained
by the trammels of conventiality! How little
are we disposed to go out of the usual track, even
in saving souls! Very few are disposed to imitate
the boldness, ingenuity, and novelty of that noble-hearted
brother,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who hired a disengaged theatre in
the city where he dwelt, and for four months preached
there to listening and well-behaved crowds, the gospel
of salvation; and for his reward had very many given
to him, who are his joy now, and will be his crown of
rejoicing in the presence of Christ at his coming.
Who can see Paul on Mars-Hill, addressing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
to the sages and their followers of all sects, and
preaching to them a doctrine so repugnant to the
mythology of the temple and the philosophy of the
schools, as Christ, the last judgment, and the resurrection
of the body, without being impressed with the
moral courage of such an act? It is this spiritual
heroism that is wanted in our modern preaching, and
indeed, which was no less needful when the Methodistic
company commenced their preaching.</p>

<p>"Nor is it only in this unwillingness to go off from
our own ground for saving souls that our guilty cowardice
is seen, but in the disposition to shirk the more
solemn and searching truths of revelation. Are we
not giving way too much to the fastidiousness of
modern taste and refinement, which is craving after
smooth things; which desires the sentimental, the
picturesque, the imaginative, but turns with disgust
from the solemn, the alarming, the awakening? Are
we not too gentle and courteous to mention such a
word as 'hell' to modern ears polite? Are we not
too fearful to break in with the thunders of a violated
law upon those who are at ease in Zion? I do not
ask for a gross, revolting method of describing the
punishment of the wicked, as if the preacher delighted
in harrowing up the feelings of his audience. This is
as disgusting as if, in order to keep men from crime,
our judges and magistrates were ever and anon giving
a minute detail of the process of an execution, and the
convulsive pangs of an expiring wretch suspended to
the beam of the gibbet. We ask not for a harsh,
scolding, and denunciating style of preaching; but
we do want more of the unflinching boldness, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
dauntless courage, which, are necessary to fidelity,
and absolutely essential to him who would win souls
to Christ. It is too generally forgotten, that our
Lord Jesus, who was incarnate love, was the most
solemn and awful of all preachers. He whose gentle
spirit so often breathed out itself in invitation, and
whose compassion melted into tears, at other times
robed himself in terror, and uttered the most alarming
peals of divine indignation. What we need for
our ministry is this mixture of tenderness and solemnity,
which entered so deeply into the ministry of
Christ, and was so characteristic of his servant, whose
labors we this day commemorate and commend."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hear also the Rev. John Glanville, the present
successor of Whitefield in the Tabernacle at Bristol:
"And such preaching <em>must continue</em>, if the world is to
be saved. Nothing but this is suited to man's necessities;
nothing else can meet man's miseries. The
battle must be fought with the old, well-tried, but not
worn-out weapons. God has provided them, and we
must use them. We require nothing else; the world
has not outgrown the old gospel, so as to need something
new to soothe its sorrows and satisfy its wants.</p>

<p>"Not that ministers can now produce the effect
Whitefield did. He was a man standing alone. The
charm and power of his preaching have never been
explained. It was all fire and flame, shooting out
red-hot thunderbolts against the citadels of sin. It
was an undivided soul, solemnly consecrated to one
object&mdash;an entire life, zealously employed in one thing.
As he preached, every feature spoke, the whole man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
became vocal, and the truth of God stood out in its full
proportions and beauty, in the bright and broad daylight
of heaven. So unreserved was his self-consecration,
that every thing was deemed impertinent which
obtruded upon, or interfered with the one great end
of his existence. He lived in communion with God&mdash;more
in heaven than on earth. He was much at the
foot of the throne, and got his strength there; he
prevailed with men, because he had prevailed with
God. His whole soul was filled with life, and fired
with love, from being in habitual contact with the
cross.</p>

<p>"And <em>we</em> must pursue the same course, and try to
do the same thing. We have the power, and we must
bring it forth and use it. God has given the machinery,
and it is for us to set it in motion. The world
is perishing, and we must save it; it is dying, and we
must give it life. God from his eternal throne calls
us&mdash;Christ from his bleeding cross speaks to us&mdash;voices
from the abodes of sin, and the regions of despair,
sound in our ears. And we all, as ministers
and as members, must rise up in the vigor of piety
and the fervor of prayer. We must rise up from the
slumbers of selfishness, and tear off the fetters of the
world, and act as those who believe in the existence
of an eternal heaven and an eternal hell, and that all
souls will be found in the one or in the other&mdash;as
those who have a great work to do, and but a short
and uncertain time to do it in. Awake, awake, put
on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the
ancient days, in the generations of old."</p>
